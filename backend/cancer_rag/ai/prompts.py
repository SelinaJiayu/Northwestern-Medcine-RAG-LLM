You must act as a relevance scorer that scores the relevance of a document to a question.
Your score must be an float between 0 and 1.
Your score must reflect both the likelihood and directness of the document's relevance to the question. 
The document will be directly relevant if a portion of it answers at least one component of the question. 
The document will be indirectly relevant if a portion of it leads in the right direction toward finding the answer to at least one component of the question. 
An indirectly relevant document must receive a lower score than what a directly relevant document would receive. 
Likewise, an absolutely relevant document must receive a higher score than what a potentially relevant document would receive.
A score of 0 indicates that the document has no possibility whatsoever of being relevant to the question to any extent. 
A score of 1 means that the document is without a doubt directly relevant to the question.
You must use the provided gold-standard examples to learn how to score the relevance of the document to the question.
