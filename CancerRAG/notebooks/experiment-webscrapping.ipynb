      "    \n",
      "external beam therapy, in which high-energy x-ray beams generated by a machine are directed at the tumor from outside the body (usually by a linear accelerator) and targeted at the tumor site. These x-rays can destroy the cancer cells and careful treatment planning allows the surrounding normal tissues to be spared. No radioactive sources are placed inside the patient's body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chemotherapy—a cancer treatment that uses chemical substances or drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from dividing.\n",
      "Surgery—surgical treatments for anal cancer include:\n",
      "    \n",
      "local resection, in which a small tumor in the lower part of the anus and some of the healthy tissue surrounding it are surgically removed.\n",
      "abdominoperineal resection, in which cancer cells in the anus, rectum and part of the large intestine are removed through an incision made in the abdomen. Lymph nodes that contain cancer may also be removed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I choose from among the options?\n",
      "The team of physicians responsible for your care will provide you with information specific to your care. Your physicians will recommend the appropriate treatment and discuss your options with you. Patients undergo a specific therapy because a cancer specialist, after analyzing all available data and the condition of the patient, has recommended it as the best way to treat the cancer. Generally, however, the majority of patients treated for anal cancer will be recommended a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy administered at the same time.\n",
      "If you are to undergo radiation therapy, a radiation oncologist will determine how much radiation is needed, to which areas of the body it should be delivered, and how many doses of radiation will be necessary.\n",
      "If I receive radiation therapy, will surgery still be required?\n",
      "The team of physicians responsible for your care will decide whether surgery would be recommended after completion of a course of radiation therapy. If surgery is recommended, the procedure performed is typically an abdominoperineal resection. Surgery is often recommended if your cancer does not completely respond to radiation therapy or if the cancer recurs in the anal canal after an initial period of treatment response.\n",
      "How effective is modern radiation treatment of anal cancer?\n",
      "Anal cancer is generally responsive to radiation therapy. Chemotherapy further improves upon the efficacy of radiation therapy. Recent improvements in radiation therapy also allow for improved sparing of normal tissues. Ultimately, however, the effectiveness of treatment is dependent on the stage of the cancer and your cancer's specific response to treatment.\n"
