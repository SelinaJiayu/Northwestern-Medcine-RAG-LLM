Question,Answer
What is radiation therapy?,"Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is a cancer treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. At low doses, radiation is used as an x-ray to see inside your body and take pictures, such as x-rays of your teeth or broken bones."
How is radiation therapy given?,"Radiation therapy can be external beam or internal. External beam involves a machine outside your body that aims radiation at cancer cells. Internal radiation therapy involves placing radiation inside your body, in or near the cancer. Sometimes people get both forms of radiation therapy. To learn more about external beam radiation therapy, see page 9. To learn more about internal radiation therapy, see page 15."
Who gets radiation therapy?,"Many people with cancer need treatment with radiation therapy. In fact,
more than half (about 60%) of people with cancer have radiation therapy.
Sometimes, radiation therapy is the only kind of cancer treatment people have. "
What does radiation therapy do to cancer cells?,"Given in high doses, radiation kills or slows the growth of cancer cells. Radiation therapy is used to: 
1. Treat cancer. Radiation can be used to cure cancer, to prevent it from returning, or to stop or slow its growth. 

2. Reduce symptoms. When a cure is not possible, radiation may be used to treat pain and other problems caused by the cancer tumor. Or, it can prevent problems that may be caused by a growing tumor, such as blindness or loss of bowel and bladder control."
How long does radiation therapy take to work?,"Radiation therapy does not kill cancer cells right away. It takes days or weeks of treatment before cancer cells start to die. Then, cancer cells keep dying for weeks or months after radiation therapy ends."
What does radiation therapy do to healthy cells?,"Radiation not only kills or slows the growth of cancer cells, it can also affect nearby healthy cells. The healthy cells almost always recover after treatment is over. But sometimes people may have side effects that are severe or do not get better. Other side effects may show up months or years after radiation therapy is over. These are called late side effects. 

Doctors try to protect healthy cells during treatment by: 
1. Using as low a dose of radiation as possible. The radiation dose is balanced between being high enough to kill cancer cells, yet low enough to limit damage to healthy cells. 

2. Spreading out treatment over time. You may get radiation therapy once a day, or in smaller doses twice a day for several weeks. Spreading out the radiation dose allows normal cells to recover while cancer cells die. 

3. Aiming radiation at a precise part of your body. Some types of radiation therapy allow your doctor to aim high doses of radiation at your cancer while reducing radiation to nearby healthy tissue. These techniques use a computer to deliver precise radiation doses to a cancer tumor or to specific areas within the tumor."
Does radiation therapy hurt?,"No, radiation therapy does not hurt while it is being given. But the side effects that people may get from radiation therapy can cause pain and discomfort.
This booklet has a lot of information about ways that you and your doctor and nurse can help manage side effects."
Is radiation therapy used with other types of cancer treatment?,"Yes, radiation therapy is often used with other cancer treatments. Here are some examples: 

1.	Radiation therapy and surgery. Radiation may be given before, during, or after surgery. Doctors may use radiation to shrink the size of the cancer before surgery, or they may use radiation after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain. Sometimes, radiation therapy is given during surgery, so that it goes straight to the cancer without passing through the skin. Radiation therapy given during surgery is called intraoperative radiation. 

2.	Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Radiation may be given before, during, or after chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Before or during these other treatments, radiation therapy can shrink the cancer so that the treatments work better. After treatment, radiation can be used to kill any cancer cells that remain."
Is radiation therapy expensive?,"Yes, radiation therapy costs a lot of money. It uses complex machines and involves the services of many health care providers. The exact cost of your radiation therapy depends on the cost of health care where you live, what kind of radiation therapy you get, and how many treatments you need. Talk with your health insurance company about what services it will pay for. Most insurance plans pay for radiation therapy. To learn more, talk with the business office of the clinic or hospital where you go for treatment. If you need financial assistance, there are organizations that may be able to help. To find such organizations, go to the National Cancer Institute database, Organizations that Offer Support Services at: supportorgs.cancer.gov and search “financial assistance.”"
Should I follow a special diet while I am getting radiation therapy?,"Your body uses a lot of energy to heal during radiation therapy. It is important that you eat enough calories and protein to keep your weight the same during this time. Ask your doctor or nurse if you need a special diet while you are receiving radiation therapy. You might also find it helpful to speak with a dietitian. To learn more about foods and drinks that are high in calories or protein, see the chart on page 53. You might also read Eating Hints: Before, during, and after Cancer Treatment, a booklet from the National Cancer Institute, at: www. cancer.gov/publications/patienteducation/eating-hints."
Can I continue to work during radiation therapy?,"Some people are able to work full time during radiation therapy. Others can work only part time or not at all. How much you are able to work depends on how you feel. Ask your doctor or nurse what you may expect from the treatment you will have. You are likely to feel well enough to work when you first start radiation treatments. As time goes on, do not be surprised if you are more tired, have less energy, or feel weak. 

Once you have finished treatment, it may take a few weeks or many months to feel better. You may get to a point during radiation therapy when you feel too sick to work. Talk with your employer to find out if you can go on medical leave. Make sure that your health insurance will pay for treatment while you are on medical leave."
How can I cope with my feelings during radiation therapy? ,"Living with cancer and going through treatment can be very stressful. It is normal to feel anxious, depressed, afraid, angry, frustrated, helpless, or alone at some point during radiation therapy. But there are ways you can learn to cope with these feelings. Many people find it helpful to talk with others who are going through the same thing. To meet others, think about joining a support group. These groups meet in-person and online. You might also try relaxation or meditation exercises. Some people find prayer helpful. Exercise can also boost your mood. Try activities such as walking, biking, yoga, or water aerobics. Check with your doctor or nurse about types of exercise that you can safely do during treatment. To learn more about coping with your feelings during cancer treatment:

How do I make the most of radiation therapy?,"You have an important role to play in your radiation therapy. To get the most from this treatment: 
Arrive on time for all radiation therapy sessions.  

Ask questions and talk about your concerns.  

Tell someone on your radiation therapy team when you have side effects and changes with eating or bowel habits. 

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are in pain. Follow the advice of your doctors and nurses about how to care for yourself at home, such as: 
•	taking care of your skin 
•	drinking enough liquids 
•	eating foods to help with side effects  
•	maintaining your weight"
What happens when radiation therapy is over?," Once you have finished radiation therapy, you will need follow-up care for the rest of your life. Follow-up care refers to regular check-ups once treatment is over. During these check-ups, your doctor or nurse will see how well the radiation therapy worked, check for signs of cancer, talk with you about your treatment and care, and look for late side effects. Late side effects are those that occur six or more months after you have completed radiation therapy. During these check-ups, your doctor or nurse will:  

•	Examine you and review how you have been feeling. Your doctor can prescribe medicine or suggest other ways to treat any side effects you may have. 
•	Order lab and imaging tests, which are tests that make pictures of areas inside the body. These tests may include blood tests, x-rays, or CT, MRI, or PET scans. 
•	Discuss treatment. Your doctor may suggest that you have more treatment, such as extra radiation treatments, chemotherapy, or other types of treatment. 
•	Answer your questions and respond to your concerns. It may be helpful to write down your questions ahead of time and bring them with you. You can find sample questions on pages 49 and 50. 
For more information about late side effects, visit the National Cancer Institute’s website at www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/late-effects."
"After I have finished radiation therapy, what symptoms should I look for?","
You have gone through a lot with cancer and radiation therapy. Now you may be even more aware of your body and how you feel each day. Pay attention to changes in your body. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have: 
•	a pain that does not go away
•	new lumps, bumps, swellings, rashes, bruises, or bleeding 
•	appetite changes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation 
•	weight loss that you cannot explain 
•	a fever, cough, or hoarseness that does not go away 
•	any other symptoms that worry you"
What is external beam radiation therapy?,"External beam radiation therapy comes from a machine that aims radiation
at your cancer. The machine is large and may be noisy. It does not touch
you, but it can move around you, sending radiation to your body from
many directions.
External beam radiation therapy is a local treatment, meaning that the
radiation treats a specific part of your body. For example, if you have lung
cancer, you will have radiation only to your chest, not to the rest of your body. "
How often will I have external beam radiation therapy?,"How often will I have external beam radiation therapy? Most people have external beam radiation therapy once a day, five days a week, Monday through Friday. Treatment lasts anywhere from 2 to 10 weeks, depending on the type of cancer you have and the goal of your treatment. This span of time is called a course of treatment. Radiation therapy may also be given on other schedules. These schedules include:

- accelerated fractionation, which is treatment given in larger daily or weekly doses to reduce the number of weeks of treatment 

- hyperfractionation, which is smaller doses of radiation given more than once a day 

- hypofractionation, which is larger doses given once a day (or less often) to reduce the number of treatments Your doctor may prescribe one of these treatment schedules if they feel that it will work better for you."
Where do I go for external beam radiation therapy?,"Most of the time, you will get external beam radiation therapy as an outpatient. This means that you will have treatment at a clinic or radiation therapy center and will not spend the night in the hospital."
What happens before I begin external beam radiation treatment?,"A radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in using radiation to treat cancer) and radiation therapist will define your treatment area. You may also hear the treatment area referred to as the treatment port or treatment field. These terms refer to the places in your body that will receive radiation. You will be asked to lie very still while x-rays or scans are taken. 
The radiation therapist will put small marks (either tattoos or dots of colored ink) on your skin to mark the treatment area. These marks are needed throughout your course of radiation therapy. 

The radiation therapist will use them each day to make sure you are in the correct position. Tattoos are about the size of a freckle and will remain on your skin for the rest of your life. Ink markings will fade over time. Be careful not to remove them and tell the radiation therapist if they have faded or lost color. A body mold may be made of the part of the body that is being treated. This is a plastic or plaster form that keeps you from moving during treatment. It also helps make sure that you are in the exact same position each day of treatment. You may be fitted for a mask if you are getting radiation to the head and neck area. The mask has air holes. It attaches to the table where you will lie for your treatments. The mask helps keep your head from moving so that you are in the exact same position for each treatment. If using the body mold or mask makes you feel anxious, see page 13 for ways to relax during treatment."
What should I wear for external beam radiation therapy?,"Wear clothes that are comfortable and made of soft fabric, such as fleece or cotton. Choose clothes that are easy to take off because you may need to pull them away from the treatment area or change into a hospital gown. Do not wear clothes that are tight, such as close-fitting collars or waistbands, near your treatment area. Also, do not wear jewelry, adhesive bandages, or powder in the treatment area."
What happens during a treatment session?,"• You may be asked to change into a hospital gown or robe. 
• You will go to the treatment room where you will receive radiation. 
• Depending on where your cancer is, you will either sit in a chair or lie down on a treatment table. The radiation therapist will use your skin marks and body mold or face mask, if you have one, to help you get into the correct position. 
• You may see colored lights pointed at your skin marks. These lights are harmless and help the therapist position you for treatment each day. 

• You will need to stay very still so the radiation goes to the exact same place each time. You will get radiation for one to five minutes. During this time, you can breathe normally and do not have to hold your breath. The radiation therapist will leave the room just before your treatment begins. They will go to a nearby room to control the radiation machine. The therapist can watch you on a TV screen or through a window and talk with you through a speaker in the treatment room. Be sure to tell the therapist if you feel sick or are uncomfortable. They can stop the radiation machine at any time. You won’t be able to feel, hear, see, or smell the radiation. Your entire visit may last from 30 minutes to an hour. Most of that time is spent placing you in the correct position. Certain types of radiation may take longer. Your visit may also take longer if your treatment team needs to take and review x-rays."
Will external beam radiation therapy make me radioactive?,"No, external beam radiation therapy does not make people radioactive. 
You may safely be around other people, even pregnant women, babies, and young children."
How can I relax during my treatment sessions?,"Bring something to keep you busy in the waiting room, such as a book or magazine, crossword puzzles, or knitting. 

Use headphones to listen to music or recorded books. 

Meditate, breathe deeply, pray, use imagery, or find other ways to relax.

What is internal radiation therapy?,"Internal radiation therapy is a form of treatment in which a source of radiation is put inside your body. One form of internal radiation therapy is called brachytherapy. In brachytherapy, a solid radiation source, such as seeds, ribbons, or capsules, is placed in your body in or near the cancer. 

Internal radiation can also be in liquid form. You receive liquid radiation by drinking it, swallowing a pill, or getting it through an IV line. Liquid radiation travels throughout your body, seeking out and killing cancer cells. 

Brachytherapy may be used to treat many types of cancers, such as cancers of the head and neck, breast, uterus, cervix, prostate, gallbladder, esophagus, eye, and lung. Liquid forms of internal radiation are most often used to treat thyroid cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
"What happens before I 
begin internal radiation therapy?","You will have a 1- to 2-hour meeting with your doctor or nurse to plan your treatment before you begin internal radiation therapy. At this time, you will have a physical exam, talk about your medical history, and may have imaging tests. Your doctor will discuss the type of internal radiation therapy that is best for you, its benefits and side effects, and ways you can care for yourself during and after treatment. You can then decide whether to have internal radiation therapy."
How is brachytherapy put in place?,"Most brachytherapy is put in place through a catheter, which is a small, stretchy tube. Sometimes, brachytherapy is put in place through a larger device called an applicator. Your doctor will place the catheter or applicator into your body before you begin treatment. Once the catheter or applicator is in place, the radiation source will be placed inside. The radiation source may be kept in place for a few minutes, for many days, or for the rest of your life. How long the radiation source remains in place depends on the type of brachytherapy you have, your type of cancer, where the cancer is in your body, your health, and other cancer treatments you have had."
What are the types of brachytherapy?,"There are three types of brachytherapy: 

Low-dose rate (LDR) implants. In this type of brachytherapy, the radiation source stays in place for one to seven days. You are likely to be in the hospital during this time. Once your treatment is finished, your doctor will remove the radiation source and the catheter or applicator. 

High-dose rate (HDR) implants. In this type of brachytherapy, the radiation source is left in place for just 10 to 20 minutes at a time and then taken out. You may have treatment twice a day for two to five days or once a week for two to five weeks. The schedule depends on your type of cancer. During the course of treatment, your catheter or applicator may stay in place, or it may be put in place before each treatment. You may be in the hospital during this time or you may make daily trips to the hospital. As with LDR implants, your doctor will remove the catheter or applicator once you have finished treatment. 

Permanent implants. After the radiation source is put in place, the catheter is removed. The implants always stay in your body, but the radiation gets weaker each day. As time goes on, almost all radiation will go away. When the radiation is first put in place, you may need to limit your time around other people. Be extra careful not to spend time with children or pregnant women."
"What happens while the 
radiation is in place?","With brachytherapy, your body fluids (urine, sweat, and saliva) will not give off radiation, but the radiation source will. With liquid radiation, your body fluids will give off radiation for a while. If the radiation you receive is a very high dose, safety measures may include: 
• Staying in a private hospital room to protect others from radiation coming from your body. 
• Being treated quickly by nurses and other hospital staff. They will provide all the care you need, but they may stand at a distance and talk with you from the doorway to your room. 

Your visitors will also need to follow safety measures, which may include: 
• not being allowed to visit when the radiation is first put in Î needing to check with the hospital staff before they go to your room 
• keeping visits short (30 minutes or less each day). The length of visits depends on the type of radiation being used and the part of your body being treated. 
• standing by the doorway rather than going into your hospital room Î not having visits from pregnant women and children younger than a year old You may also need to follow safety measures once you leave the hospital, such as not spending much time with other people. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you about any safety measures you should follow when you go home.

High-dose rate (HDR) implants. In this type of brachytherapy, the radiation source is left in place for just 10 to 20 minutes at a time and then taken out. You may have treatment twice a day for two to five days or once a week for two to five weeks. The schedule depends on your type of cancer. During the course of treatment, your catheter or applicator may stay in place, or it may be put in place before each treatment. You may be in the hospital during this time or you may make daily trips to the hospital. As with LDR implants, your doctor will remove the catheter or applicator once you have finished treatment. 

Permanent implants. After the radiation source is put in place, the catheter is removed. The implants always stay in your body, but the radiation gets weaker each day. As time goes on, almost all radiation will go away. When the radiation is first put in place, you may need to limit your time around other people. Be extra careful not to spend time with children or pregnant women."
"What happens when the 
catheter is taken out after treatment with LDR or HDR implants?","
• You will get medicine for pain before the catheter or applicator is removed. 
• The area where the catheter or applicator was might be tender for a few months. 
• There is no radiation in your body after the catheter or applicator is removed. It is safe for people to be near you—even young children and pregnant women. 
• For a week or two, you may need to limit activities that take a lot of effort. Ask your doctor what kinds of activities are safe for you and which ones you should avoid."
What is external beam therapy and how is it used?,"External beam therapy (EBT), also called external radiation therapy, is a method for delivering a beam or several beams of high-energy x-rays to a patient's tumor. Beams are generated outside the patient (usually by a linear accelerator, see below) and are targeted at the tumor site. These high energy x-rays can deposit their dose to the area of the tumor to destroy the cancer cells and, with careful treatment planning, spare the surrounding normal tissues. No radioactive sources are placed inside the patient's body.

External beam therapy is used to treat the following diseases as well as many others:

Breast Cancer Treatment, Colorectal (Bowel) Cancer Treatment, Esophageal Cancer Treatment, Head and Neck Cancer Treatment, Lung Cancer Treatment,
Prostate Cancer Treatment, Brain Tumor Treatment.
External beam therapy is most commonly used to treat cancer. Often, the goal is to eliminate a tumor or prevent a tumor from returning. The procedure may also be performed before or after surgery to remove a cancerous tumor, to reduce the tumor size before surgery, or to prevent the tumor from coming back after surgery.

EBT may also be used as a palliative treatment in patients with advanced stage cancer or cancer that has metastasized. In this case, the goal of therapy is to reduce a patient's symptoms rather than cure the cancer."
Who operates external beam radiotherapy equipments?,"The equipment is operated by a radiation therapist, a highly trained technologist. The overall treatment plan is created by the radiation oncologist, a highly trained physician specializing in treating cancer with radiotherapy."
Is there any special preparation needed for external beam therapy procedure?,"The process of external beam therapy involves three parts:

Simulation, Treatment Planning, Treatment Delivery.
The goal of simulation is to determine the treatment position that will be used daily, to make devices that will help the patient maintain that position, and to obtain the necessary images for treatment planning. The radiation therapist places the patient in the treatment position on a CT scanner. Masks, pads or other immobilization devices are typically used to help the patient to hold still and in a specific position during the simulation. These devices will be used for the treatment to achieve the same position daily, so it is important that the patient can maintain that position. Images of the treatment area are taken in the treatment position. The radiation therapist places small marks on the patients to help guide the daily treatments. These marks may be tattoos or colored ink. The tattoos will be permanent, but the colored ink will eventually fade. Marker seeds may be placed in the target tumor or organ at simulation or during a separate surgical procedure. These seeds or markings are intended to help the radiation therapist position the patient during each treatment session.

For treatment planning, the dosimetrist, medical physicist and radiation oncologist use a special computer program to calculate the radiation dose that will be delivered to the patient's tumor and the surrounding normal tissue. The radiation oncologist will determine the volume of the tumor and other areas that need to be treated and outline those on the treatment planning images. He or she will also outline normal structures that should be avoided or considered in devising the treatment plan. Together, the oncologist, dosimetrist and physicist will generate a treatment plan that delivers the appropriate dose to the tumor while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. In certain cases, this process may employ such techniques as three-dimensional conformal therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). This planning is based on CT, MRI and PET/CT scans which may be done in the radiology department or the radiation oncology department.

After the simulation and planning have been completed, the treatment can begin."
How is external beam therapy procedure performed?,"Before each treatment session, the patient may be asked to change into a gown. The radiation therapist brings the patient into the treatment room and places him/her on the treatment couch of the linear accelerator in exactly the same position that was used for simulation using the same immobilization devices. The therapist carefully positions the patient using the alignment lasers and the marks that had been placed on the patient during simulation. Some form of imaging is often used prior to the treatment delivery to verify the accuracy of the patient setup. Some of the types of imaging that can be used include x-rays, ultrasound and cone beam CT. The therapist goes outside the room and turns on the linear accelerator from outside. Beams from one or more directions may be used and the beam may be on for as long as several minutes for each field.

The treatment process can take one hour or less each day and most of the time is often spent positioning and imaging the patient. The first treatment usually takes the longest; subsequent treatments take between 15 and 30 minutes. The actual treatment may last only several minutes. The duration of a patient's treatment depends on the method of treatment delivery, such as IMRT, and the dose given. The length of each treatment will usually be the same from day to day.

Patients usually receive radiation treatments once a day, five days a week for a total of two to nine weeks. The patient's diagnosis determines the total duration of treatment. Occasionally, treatments are given twice a day."
What will I feel during external beam therapy procedure?,"External beam therapy is painless but patients will hear buzzing or clicking noises during treatment. The linear accelerator may rotate or move during treatment. Patients feel nothing out of the ordinary, but may sometimes smell an odd smell during treatment that is caused by the ozone produced by the linear accelerator. Some patients may also see a colored light when they receive their treatment; this event is especially true for patients having their brain or eye treated.

Your doctor may recommend a series of follow-up exams after treatment. These may include a physical check-up, imaging exam(s), and blood or other lab tests.

These visits help your doctor see if your condition is stable or has changed. They also allow you to discuss any treatment side effects with your doctor."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect after external beam therapy?,"Once treatment is complete, patients are asked to return for follow-up visits. During these appointments, patients will undergo evaluation, including imaging exams or blood tests, to determine if their cancer has been eliminated or if additional treatment is required. Even if the cancer has been cured, patients can expect to continue periodic visits to follow-up with their doctor."
What is MR LINAC used for?,"Doctors use MR LINAC to treat patients with cancer. It delivers high-energy x-rays to the region of the patient’s tumor. Doctors and physicists can design these treatments in such a way that the radiation destroys the cancer cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue.

The MR LINAC uses continuous MRI to see the soft tissue and organs moving. This allows doctors to track the tumor motion and then compensate for these movements during treatment. This is useful for tumors in the lung, prostate, bowel, and bladder that may change position often.

MRI does a better job at showing soft tissues than x-rays or other imaging. Treatment is safer with potentially fewer side effects and allows a higher dose to reach the target. This minimizes the chance of damage to healthy organs near the tumor.

The MR LINAC has advanced software that allows your doctors to adapt your radiation treatment plan based on what they see each day."
How does the MR LINAC equipment work?,"MR LINAC is a significant technological leap in cancer treatment. It combines the imaging power of MRI with a linear accelerator to deliver treatment. To avoid interference, the treatment team splits the magnetic field of the MR LINAC to make space for the linear accelerator. This allows radiation to pass through the gap. MRI can then create images without distortion.

Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, obtains detailed images of organs and tissues throughout the body without the need for x-rays. Instead, MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radio waves, rapidly changing magnetic fields, and a computer to create images. These images can show whether there is an injury, disease process, or abnormal condition present.

For the MRI exam, the patient lies inside the MR system or scanner—typically a large donut-shaped device that is open on both ends. The powerful magnetic field aligns atomic particles called protons that exist in body tissues that contain water. The applied radio waves then interact with these protons to produce signals that a receiver picks up within the MR scanner. The signals are specially characterized using the rapidly changing magnetic fields. Computer processing creates cross-sectional images of tissues as “slices” that the radiologist can view in any orientation.

An MRI exam causes no pain. The electromagnetic fields produce no known tissue damage of any kind. The MR system may make loud tapping, knocking, or other noises at times during the procedure. The radiation therapist will provide earplugs to prevent problems that may be associated with noise generated by the scanner. At all times, staff will monitor you. You will be able to communicate with the radiation therapist using an intercom system or by other means.

The linear accelerator uses microwave technology (like that used for radar) to accelerate electrons in a part of the accelerator called the “wave guide.” The electrons then collide with a heavy metal target to produce high-energy x-rays. The MR LINAC shapes these high energy x-rays as they exit the machine to conform to the shape of the patient’s tumor. The customized beam is directed to the patient’s tumor. The beam is usually shaped by a multileaf collimator that is incorporated into the head of the machine. The patient lies on a moveable treatment couch. The radiation therapist uses lasers to make sure the patient is in the proper position. The treatment couch can move in many directions including up, down, right, left, in and out. The beam comes out of a part of the accelerator called a gantry, which can rotate around the patient. The machine can deliver radiation to the tumor from many angles by rotating the gantry and moving the treatment couch."
Who operates the MR LINAC?,Your radiation oncologist prescribes the proper treatment volume and dosage. The medical physicist and the dosimetrist figure out how to deliver the prescribed dose. They also figure the amount of time it will take the accelerator to deliver that dose. Radiation therapists run the MRI scanner and the linear accelerator and give patients their daily treatments.
How is safety of MR LINAC ensured?,"The MR-LINAC is an FDA-cleared device. It has built-in safety measures to ensure that it will deliver the dose as prescribed. Medical physicists routinely check it to ensure it is working properly. The powerful magnetic field of the MR system can attract objects made from certain metals. This may cause them to move suddenly and with great force. Therefore, great care is taken to ensure that no one brings outside objects such as ferromagnetic screwdrivers and oxygen tanks into the MR system room. All MRI facilities have screening procedures and protocols to identify any potential hazards. These steps ensure that the MRI technologist and radiologist know about the presence of any metallic objects. They can then take precautions as needed.

Some MRI exams involve the use of a contrast material known as gadolinium. It helps improve the information seen on the MR images. Unlike the contrast materials used in x-ray exams or computed tomography (CT) scans, a gadolinium contrast agent does not contain iodine. Therefore, it rarely causes an allergic reaction or other problem.

Before receiving a gadolinium contrast agent, tell the MRI technologist and/or radiologist if you have a history of:
kidney disease, kidney failure, kidney transplant, liver disease related conditions.

Before treatment, the radiation oncologist develops a plan. The radiation dosimetrist and medical physicist help with the plan. The treatment team performs quality-assurance procedures to ensure that they deliver the treatment as planned.

Quality assurance of the linear accelerator is crucial. The accelerator has several systems built in so that it will not deliver a higher dose than prescribed. Each morning before any patient undergoes treatment, the radiation therapist checks the machine. This ensures that the radiation intensity is uniform across the beam and that it is working properly. In addition, the medical physicist conducts more detailed monthly and annual checks of the accelerator.

Modern linear accelerators also have internal checking systems. These systems do not allow the machine to be turned on unless all the prescribed treatment requirements are met.

During treatment, the radiation therapist observes the patient on a closed-circuit television monitor. There is also a microphone in the treatment room so that the patient can speak with staff if needed.

Safety of the staff operating the linear accelerator is also important. The linear accelerator sits in a room with lead and concrete walls. This shields the high-energy x-rays. This means that no one outside of the room is exposed to the x-rays. The radiation therapist must turn on the accelerator from outside the treatment room. Because the accelerator only emits radiation when it is turned on, the risk of accidental exposure is extremely low."
What is Gamma Knife equipment used for?,"The Gamma Knife® and its associated computerized treatment planning software enable physicians to locate and irradiate relatively small targets in the head (mostly inside the brain) with extremely high precision. Intense doses of radiation can be given to the targeted area(s) while largely sparing the surrounding tissues. The Gamma Knife® can be used for a wide variety of problems. For example, it can be used to treat selected malignant tumors that arise in or spread to the brain (primary brain tumors or metastatic tumors), benign brain tumors (meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, acoustic neuromas), blood vessel defects (arteriovenous malformations) and functional problems (trigeminal neuralgia). Possible future uses are being evaluated for epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.

Single-session Gamma Knife® treatment is usually unsuitable for targets larger than three or four centimeters in size."
"How does the Gamma Knife equipment work?
","The Gamma Knife® utilizes a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery, which uses multiple beams of radiation converging in three dimensions to focus precisely on a small volume, such as a tumor, permitting intense doses of radiation to be delivered to that volume safely. Currently, the available models use advanced robotic technology to move the patient in submillimeter increments during treatment to focus radiation successfully on all parts of the target.

Most treatments are given in a single session. Under local anesthesia, a special rigid head frame incorporating a three-dimensional coordinate system is attached to the patient's skull with four screws. Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or angiography, are then obtained and the results are sent to the Gamma Knife®'s planning computer system. Together, physicians (radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons) and medical physicists delineate targets and normal anatomical structures. They use a planning computer program to determine the exact spatial relationship between the target, normal structures and the head frame to calculate Gamma Knife® treatment parameters. Targets often are best treated during the treatment session with combinations of several successive highly focused treatments, commonly known as ""shots."" The physicians and physicists routinely consider numerous fine-tuning adjustments of treatment parameters until an optimal plan and dose are determined.

Using the three-dimensional coordinates determined in the planning process, the frame is then precisely attached to the Gamma Knife® unit to guarantee that when the unit is activated, the target is placed exactly in the center of approximately 200 precision-aimed, converging beams of (Cobalt-60 generated) gamma radiation. Treatment takes anywhere from several minutes to a few hours to complete depending on the shape and size of the target, the number of ""shots"" and the dose required. Patients do not feel the radiation treatment as it is delivered, although they may experience seeing flashes of light while the treatment is being delivered. Following treatment the head frame is removed and the patient may return to normal activity.

Treatments using Icon
Icon treatments differ from Perfexion treatments in that:

Treatments are given in single or multiple sessions.
An external frame is not required.
Icon uses a combination of onboard stereotactic Cone Beam CT imaging and real-time infrared motion detection and management to achieve 0.15 mm treatment accuracy even without a rigid frame."
Who operates the Gamma Knife equipment?,"A multidisciplinary team approach provides patients with the greatest safety. The team is most commonly comprised of a radiation oncologist, a medical physicist and a neurosurgeon—all specially trained in the use of the Gamma Knife®—with support from nursing staff, anesthesiologists (for patients who are unable to cooperate, such as children) and radiation therapists, who work together to provide patients with the high-quality care they deserve. It is a requirement of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that an ""authorized user,"" usually a radiation oncologist, be at the treatment console during the entire procedure"
How is safety ensured for Gamma Knife?,"Because placement accuracy of the shots is critical to localization of the radiation (to a fraction of a millimeter), anything that would degrade this precision is unacceptable. Rigid attachment of the head frame, geographic targeting accuracy of the imaging studies, shaping of the volume of tissue to be treated (selection of the number, size and relative intensity of the shots) and accuracy of attachment of the frame to the Gamma Knife® unit are all critical. As is true of all radiation therapy procedures, correct selection and calculation of the amount of radiation to deliver are essential. A qualified medical physicist assures that the imaging and treatment planning computers and software are correct and acceptable. The mechanical functions of the machine are tested on a regular basis to ensure the safety of patients and medical staff."
What is stereotactic radiosurgery and how is it used?,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a highly precise form of radiation therapy initially developed to treat small brain tumors and functional abnormalities of the brain. The principles of cranial SRS, namely high precision radiation where delivery is accurate to within one to two millimeters, are now being applied to the treatment of body tumors with a procedure known as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Despite its name, SRS is a non-surgical procedure that delivers precisely-targeted radiation at much higher doses, in only a single or few treatments, as compared to traditional radiation therapy. This treatment is only possible due to the development of highly advanced radiation technologies that permit maximum dose delivery within the target while minimizing dose to the surrounding healthy tissue. The goal is to deliver doses that will destroy the tumor and achieve permanent local control.

SRS and SBRT rely on several technologies:  three-dimensional imaging and localization techniques that determine the exact coordinates of the target within the body;
systems to immobilize and carefully position the patient and maintain the patient position during therapy; highly focused gamma-ray or x-ray beams that converge on a tumor or abnormality; image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) which uses medical imaging to confirm the location of a tumor immediately before, and in some cases, during the delivery of radiation. IGRT improves the precision and accuracy of the treatment. Three-dimensional imaging, such as CT, MRI, and PET/CT is used to locate the tumor or abnormality within the body and define its exact size and shape. These images also guide the treatment planning—in which beams of radiation are designed to converge on the target area from different angles and planes—as well as the careful positioning of the patient for therapy sessions.

Although SRS commonly refers to a one-day treatment, physicians sometimes recommend multiple stereotactic delivered treatments. This is important for tumors larger than one inch in diameter as the surrounding normal tissue exposed to the single high dose of radiation must be respected and limited, and the volume of normal tissue treated increases proportionally to the tumor size. Delivering the radiation in a few sessions as opposed to one, can improve safety and allow the normal tissue to heal in between treatments. Therefore, fractionating the treatment allows for high doses to still be delivered within the target, while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. This procedure is usually referred to as fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), and typically refers to the delivery of two to five treatments of focused radiation and are not always given on consecutive days.
SRS and SBRT are important alternatives to invasive surgery, especially for patients who are unable to undergo surgery and for tumors and abnormalities that are:
hard to reach, located close to vital organs/anatomic regions, subject to movement within the body.

SRS is used to treat: many types of brain tumors including: benign and malignant, primary and metastatic, single and multiple, residual tumor cells following surgery, intracranial, orbital and base-of-skull tumors, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), a tangle of expanded blood vessels that disrupts normal blood flow in the brain and sometimes bleeds, other neurological conditions like trigeminal neuralgia (a nerve disorder in the face), tremor, etc.

SBRT is currently used and/or being investigated for use in treating malignant or benign small-to-medium size tumors in the body and common disease sites, including the:
lung, liver, abdomen, spine, prostate, head and neck.
SRS fundamentally works in the same way as other forms of radiation treatment. It does not actually remove the tumor; rather, it damages the DNA of tumor cells. As a result, these cells lose their ability to reproduce. Following treatment, benign tumors usually shrink over a period of 18 months to two years. Malignant and metastatic tumors may shrink more rapidly, even within a couple of months. When treated with SRS, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) may begin to thicken and close off slowly over a period of several years following treatment. Many tumors will remain stable and inactive without any change. Since the aim is to prevent tumor growth, this is considered a success. In some tumors, like acoustic neuromas, a temporary enlargement may be observed following SRS due to an inflammatory response within the tumor tissue that overtime either stabilizes, or a subsequent tumor regression is observed called pseudoprogression."
What equipment is used for SRS and SBRT?,"There are three basic kinds of equipment, each of which uses different instruments and sources of radiation:

The Gamma Knife®, which uses 192 or 201 beams of highly focused gamma rays all aiming at the target region. The Gamma Knife is ideal for treating small to medium size intracranial lesions. See the Gamma Knife page for more information.
Linear accelerator (LINAC) machines, prevalent throughout the world, deliver high-energy x-rays, also known as photons. The linear accelerator can perform SRS on larger tumors in a single session or during multiple sessions, which is called fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Multiple manufacturers make this type of machine, which have brand names such as Novalis Tx™, XKnife™, Axesse™ and CyberKnife®. See the Linear Accelerator page for more information.
Proton beam or heavy-charged-particle radiosurgery is in limited use in North America, though the number of centers offering proton therapy has increased dramatically in the last several years. See the Proton Therapy page for more information."
"For SRS or SBRT, who will be involved in this procedure and who operates the equipment?","The treatment team is comprised of a number of specialized medical professionals, typically including a radiation oncologist, medical radiation physicist, radiologist, dosimetrist, radiation therapist, and radiation therapy nurse.

The radiation oncologist and, in some cases, a neurosurgeon lead the treatment team and oversee the treatment; they outline the target(s) to be treated, identify any sensitive tissues or organs at risk, decide on the appropriate radiation dose, approve the treatment plan, and interpret the results of radiosurgical procedures.
A radiologist interprets imaging that identifies the target(s) to be treated in the brain or body.
The medical radiation physicist ensures the delivery of the precise dose of radiation.
The physicist, or a dosimetrist under the supervision of the physicist, uses special computer software to devise a treatment plan; he or she calculates the exposures and beam configuration to conformally treat the target(s) to the prescribed dose.
A highly trained radiation therapist positions the patient on the treatment table and operates the machine from an adjacent protected area. The radiation therapist can observe the patient through a window or on a closed-circuit television and is able to communicate with the patient throughout the procedure. In the case of the Gamma Knife, the neurosurgeon and/or radiation oncologist may help position the patient for treatment and the radiation oncologist may operate the machine.
The radiation therapy nurse assesses the patient, provides the patient with information about the treatment, monitors the patient during treatment, and helps answer questions after treatment.
A neurologist or neuro-oncologist may participate with the radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon in the multidisciplinary team that considers various treatment options for individual cases and helps decide who may benefit from radiosurgery for lesions in the brain."
"For SRS or SBRT, how is the procedure performed?","• Stereotactic Radiosurgery Using the Gamma Knife
Gamma Knife radiosurgery involves four phases: placement of the head frame, imaging of the tumor location, computerized dose planning, and radiation delivery. Under some circumstances, some facilities may use a plastic head mask instead of the head frame.

In the first phase, a nurse will place a small needle in your hand or arm to give you medications and contrast, if needed, for imaging. A neurosurgeon will use local anesthesia to numb two spots on your forehead and two spots on the back of your head. A box-shaped head frame will be attached to your skull using specially designed pins to keep your head from moving within the frame until the treatment session is finished. This lightweight aluminum head frame is also a guiding device that makes sure the Gamma Knife beams are focused exactly where the treatment is needed.

Next, you will be taken to an imaging area where a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed to show the exact location of the tumor in relation to the head frame. In some cases, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be performed instead of, or in addition to, an MRI scan. If you are having treatment for an arteriovenous malformation, you may also have an angiogram. New developments in Gamma Knife software allow for pre-planning. Therefore, you may have your treatment planning MR images prior to the day of your treatment to improve the efficiency of the treatment process.

During the next phase, you will be able to relax for an hour or two while your treatment team identifies the tumor(s) for treatment and develops a treatment plan using special computer software to optimally irradiate the tumor and minimize dose to surrounding normal tissues.

Next, you will lie down on the Gamma Knife bed and your head frame will be fixed to the machine before beginning treatment. You will be made comfortable with a pillow or wedge-shaped sponge under your knees and a blanket over you. The treatment team will then go to the control area outside the treatment room to begin your treatment. You will be able to talk to your physician through a microphone in the helmet, and a camera will allow the team to see you at all times. The bed you are lying on will move backward into the Gamma Knife machine. You will not feel the treatment and the machine is very quiet. Depending on the Gamma Knife model and the treatment plan, the whole treatment may be performed without interruption or it may be broken up into multiple smaller parts. The total treatment may last less than one hour or up to four hours. A chime will sound when the treatment is complete and the bed will return to its original position. As soon as the treatment is finished, you will sit up and the head frame will be removed. In most cases, you should be able to go home soon afterward.

• Radiosurgery Using the Linear Accelerator
Linear accelerator (LINAC) SRS is similar to the Gamma Knife procedure and its four phases: head frame placement, imaging, computerized dose planning and radiation delivery. LINAC technology is much more common than Gamma Knife technology and has been in practice for a similar length of time. Unlike the Gamma Knife, which remains motionless during the procedure, part of the LINAC machine (called a gantry) rotates around the patient delivering the radiation beams from different angles. Obtaining the MRI before frame placement is also a more routine pre-planning practice with LINAC-based SRS. A CT with the frame in place is also commonly acquired.

When SRS is delivered using CyberKnife, a robotic arm moves the compact LINAC around the patient under image-guidance. The CyberKnife is also based on delivering SRS without an invasive head frame, and a more simple plastic head mask can be used to keep the head from moving during delivery which can improve patient comfort. The development of frameless SRS is possible due to the incorporation of image-guidance in the delivery of treatment. Now, most LINAC based SRS technology is moving towards frameless SRS. The Gamma Knife has also developed frameless technology in order to spare the patient the invasive frame placement procedure. Frameless SRS also allows for fractionated SRS, or SBRT, which again may be an advantage for large tumors or those in particularly critical locations.

• SBRT
SBRT typically consists of one to five treatment sessions delivered over the course of one to two weeks.

For some technologies like the CyberKnife that base image-guidance according to an x-ray based solution, you may be asked to have a fiducial marker placed in or near your tumor for selected cases. However, for most CT based image-guidance technologies, this step is not needed. If a fiducial is required, depending on the location of your tumor, your radiation oncologist may work with a pulmonologist, gastroenterologist or radiologist to have one to four fiducial markers placed near the tumor. Placement of the fiducial marker is almost always an outpatient procedure.

Next, your radiation oncologist will determine the method of aligning your body with the beams from the linear accelerator, which is called a simulation. Immobilization devices are often used to align patients very precisely and make sure they remain still during simulation and treatment. Some of these systems may hold you quite tight; therefore you should tell your physician if you suffer from claustrophobia. After an immobilization device is created for you, a CT scan is performed over the area to be treated. Your physicians may also perform a '4DCT,' where the CT scan obtains information on how your tumor moves while you breathe. This is very common for tumors in the lungs or liver. After the scan is completed, you will be sent home.

The third part of the course is planning. The radiation oncologist will work with a radiation dosimetrist and medical physicist to plan the beam arrangement best suited for your tumor. They may incorporate other imaging techniques, such as MRI or PET/CT. Using specialized software, the team will go through hundreds of different combinations of beams to figure out which would be best for your situation.

Radiation delivery of SBRT is done on a linear accelerator. There are normally no restrictions on eating or drinking, though some patients may take an anti-inflammatory, anti-nausea or anti-anxiety medication prior to the treatment. You will be placed in the immobilization device. X-rays or a CT scan (depending on the mode of image-guidance specific to the LINAC technology) will be taken to line up the beams of radiation with the tumor prior to starting the radiation therapy. The radiation therapist will position you with guidance from the radiation oncologist based on these x-rays. The radiation therapist will then deliver the treatment. Sometimes, x-rays or a CT scan will be taken during the treatment to monitor the position of the tumor. Treatment can take up to one hour or more."
"For SRS or SBRT, is there any special preparation needed for the procedure?","SRS and SBRT are usually performed on an outpatient basis. However, be prepared to spend up to a half-day or more at the facility. You will be informed whether you need to have someone accompany you and drive you home afterward.

You may be asked not to eat or drink anything after midnight on the night before your treatment. You should ask your physician about taking any medications on the day of your treatment and bring those medications with you to the procedure. You should also tell your physician if any of the following apply to you:

You are taking medications by mouth or insulin to control diabetes.
You are allergic to intravenous contrast material or iodine.
You have a pacemaker, artificial heart valve, defibrillator, brain aneurysm clips, implanted pumps or chemotherapy ports, neurostimulators, eye or ear implants, stents, coils or filters.
You suffer from claustrophobia."
"For SRS or SBRT, what will I feel during and after the procedure?

","Radiosurgery treatments are similar to having an x-ray. In general you will not be able to see, feel or hear the x-rays. One exception is that some patients who are having treatments to the brain may see flashes of light while the machine is on, even with their eyes closed. There is no pain or discomfort from the actual treatment.

If you experience pain for other reasons, such as back pain or discomfort from the head frame or immobilization device, you should let your doctor or nurse know.

When the head frame is removed, there may be some minor bleeding from the pin sites that will be bandaged. You may experience a headache and can ask for medication to help make you feel more comfortable. In most cases, radiosurgery and SBRT patients can resume all of their normal activities within one or two days.

Side effects of radiation treatment include problems that occur as a result of the treatment itself as well as from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area. The number and severity of side effects you experience will depend on the type of radiation and dosage you receive and the part of your body being treated. You should talk to your doctor and nurse about any side effects you experience so they can help you manage them.

Radiation therapy can cause early side effects during or immediately after treatment, and are typically gone within a few weeks. Late side effects can occur months or years later. Common early side effects of radiation therapy include tiredness or fatigue and skin problems. Skin in the treatment area may become more sensitive, red, irritated, or swollen. Other skin changes include dryness, itching, peeling and blistering.

Depending on the area being treated, other early side effects may include: hair loss in the treatment area, mouth problems and difficulty swallowing, eating and digestion problems, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, headaches, soreness and swelling in the treatment area, urinary and bladder changes.

Late side effects, which are rare, occur months or years following treatment and are often permanent. They include: brain changes, spinal cord changes, lung changes, kidney changes, colon and rectal changes, infertility, joint changes, lymphedema, mouth changes, secondary cancer, fracture of bones.  There is a slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. Following radiation treatment for cancer, you should be checked on a regular basis by your radiation oncologist for recurring and new cancers.

Using techniques such as SBRT, the aim is to maximize the cancer-destroying capabilities of radiation treatment while minimizing its effect on healthy tissues to limit the side effects of the treatment itself."
What is a Linear Accelerator used for?,"A medical linear accelerator (LINAC) is the device most commonly used for external beam radiation treatments for patients with cancer. It delivers high-energy x-rays or electrons to the region of the patient's tumor. These treatments can be designed in such a way that they destroy the cancer cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. The LINAC is used to treat all body sites, using conventional techniques, Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT), Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Stereotactic Body Radio Therapy (SBRT)."
How does a Linac work?,"The linear accelerator uses microwave technology (similar to that used for radar) to accelerate electrons in a part of the accelerator called the ""wave guide,"" then allows these electrons to collide with a heavy metal target to produce high-energy x-rays. These high energy x-rays are shaped as they exit the machine to conform to the shape of the patient's tumor and the customized beam is directed to the patient's tumor. The beam is usually shaped by a multileaf collimator that is incorporated into the head of the machine. The patient lies on a moveable treatment couch and lasers are used to make sure the patient is in the proper position. The treatment couch can move in many directions including up, down, right, left, in and out. The beam comes out of a part of the accelerator called a gantry, which can be rotated around the patient. Radiation can be delivered to the tumor from many angles by rotating the gantry and moving the treatment couch."
Who operates a Linac?,The patient's radiation oncologist prescribes the appropriate treatment volume and dosage. The medical physicist and the dosimetrist determine how to deliver the prescribed dose and calculate the amount of time it will take the accelerator to deliver that dose. Radiation therapists operate the linear accelerator and give patients their daily radiation treatments.
How is safety ensured?,"Patient safety is very important and is assured in several ways.
Before treatment is delivered to the patient, a treatment plan is developed and approved by the radiation oncologist in collaboration with the radiation dosimetrist and medical physicist. The plan is double-checked before treatment is given and quality-assurance procedures are performed to ensure that the treatment will be delivered as planned.
Quality assurance of the linear accelerator is very important. There are several systems built into the accelerator so that it will not deliver a higher dose than the radiation oncologist has prescribed. Each morning before any patient is treated, the radiation therapist performs checks on the machine to make sure that the radiation intensity is uniform across the beam and that it is working properly. In addition, the medical physicist conducts more detailed monthly and annual checks of the linear accelerator.
Modern linear accelerators also have internal checking systems that do not allow the machine to be turned on unless all the prescribed treatment requirements are met.
During treatment, the radiation therapist continuously observes the patient using a closed-circuit television monitor. There is also a microphone in the treatment room so that the patient can speak to the therapist if needed. Port films (x-rays taken with the treatment beam) or other imaging tools such as cone beam CT are checked regularly to make sure that the beam position doesn't vary from the original plan.
Safety of the staff operating the linear accelerator is also important. The linear accelerator sits in a room with lead and concrete walls so that the high-energy x-rays are shielded and no one outside of the room is exposed to the x-rays. The radiation therapist must turn on the accelerator from outside the treatment room. Because the accelerator only emits radiation when it is actually turned on, the risk of accidental exposure is extremely low."
What is Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and how is it used?,"Radiation therapy, including IMRT, damages the DNA and stops cancer cells from dividing and growing, thus slowing or stopping tumor growth. In many cases, radiation therapy is capable of killing all of the cancer cells, thus shrinking or eliminating tumors. Radiation therapy may be used in conjunction with surgery (adjuvant radiation). In this scenario, radiation targets potential microscopic disease after surgery.
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced mode of high-precision radiotherapy that uses computer-controlled linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to a malignant tumor or specific areas within the tumor. IMRT allows for the radiation dose to conform more precisely to the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of the tumor by modulating—or controlling—the intensity of the radiation beam in multiple small volumes. IMRT also allows higher radiation doses to be focused on the tumor while minimizing the dose to surrounding normal critical structures. Treatment is carefully planned by using 3-D computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MRI) images of the patient in conjunction with computerized dose calculations to determine the dose intensity pattern that will best conform to the tumor shape. Typically, combinations of multiple intensity-modulated fields coming from different beam directions produce a customized radiation dose that maximizes tumor dose while also minimizing the dose to adjacent normal tissues.
Because the ratio of normal tissue dose to tumor dose is reduced to a minimum with the IMRT approach, higher and more effective radiation doses can safely be delivered to tumors with fewer side effects compared with conventional radiotherapy techniques. IMRT also has the potential to reduce treatment toxicity, even when doses are not increased. Due to its complexity, IMRT does require slightly longer daily treatment times and additional planning and safety checks before the patient can start the treatment when compared with conventional radiotherapy."
What is proton therapy and how is it used?,"Protons are particles that carry a positive charge. Just as x-rays (also known as photons) are used to treat both benign and malignant tumors, protons beams can be used to irradiate tumors in a similar way. There is no significant difference in the biological effects of protons versus photons (x-rays). However, protons deliver a dose of radiation in a much more confined way to the tumor tissue than photons. After they enter the body, protons release most of their energy within the tumor region and, unlike photons, deliver only a minimal dose beyond the tumor boundaries. Therefore, especially for smaller tumor sizes, the dose of radiation may conform much tighter to the tumor and there may be less damage to healthy tissue. As a result, the treating physician (a radiation oncologist) can potentially give an even greater dose to the tumor while minimizing unwanted side effects. This is especially important when treating children, because protons help reduce radiation to growing and developing tissues.
Proton therapy is being used to treat tumors in these areas of the body with encouraging early results: Lung - see the Lung Cancer page, Prostate - see the Prostate Cancer page, Brain - see the Brain Tumors page, Liver, Breast, Esophagus, Rectum, Skull base sarcomas, Pediatric brain tumors, Head and neck - see the Head and Neck Cancer page and Eye melanomas.
Protocols are being developed to explore the use of protons in other parts of the body."
What is Image-Guided Radiation Therapy and how is it used?,"Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) uses medical imaging to help provide precise and accurate radiation treatment.
IGRT uses a linear accelerator or cyclotron/synchrotron to produce and deliver radiation therapy. These machines may also have imaging technology to scan the tumor before or during treatment. Your doctor and radiation therapists will compare these scans to the simulation reference images and make adjustments. By adjusting your position and the radiation beams, your doctor and treatment team can more precisely deliver radiation to the tumor while avoiding healthy tissue.
IGRT may use computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US) or x-ray to scan your tumor. The procedure may place fiducial markers or electromagnetic transponders in or near the tumor. These help the treatment team identify the target area and help position the equipment. See the Fiducial Marker Placement page for more information.
IGRT treats tumors in areas that tend to move, such as the lungs, liver, pancreas, and prostate gland using fiducials, 4D gating or adaptive techniques using high soft tissue resolution imaging. It also treats tumors near critical organs and tissues. Doctors may use IGRT with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), proton beam therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). These advanced forms of high-precision radiotherapy use computers to control x-ray accelerators and deliver precise radiation doses to a tumor or specific areas within it."
Is there any special preparation needed for an IGRT?,"Women should always tell their doctor and technologist if they are pregnant or breastfeeding. See the Radiation Safety page for more information about pregnancy, breastfeeding, and imaging. Patients with loose metal in their bodies should tell the treatment team if you are to undergo MRI. Patients with pacemakers in their bodies should tell the treatment team if you are to undergo MRI or radiation treatment.
Your doctor will implant any necessary markers at least 1-2 weeks before your CT simulation. Your doctor or the radiation therapist may also mark or tattoo your skin with colored ink to help align and target the radiation equipment. Your doctor will let you know prior to treatment if they prefer you to be fasting or drink water to have full bladder. 
There is no specific preparation for IGRT other than for the specific therapy you will undergo. See the IMRT, Proton Beam Therapy, or SBRT pages for specific preparation information."
What will I feel during and after an IGRT procedure?,"Medical imaging prior to or during treatment is painless.
During treatment, you may see or hear the equipment moving. Or you may notice an odd smell (the linear accelerator produces ozone). You may even see a colored light during treatment. This is especially true for brain cancer patients.
Radiation treatment can cause side effects. These problems may result from the treatment itself or from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area.
The number and severity of side effects will depend on the type of radiation, dose, and body part under treatment. Talk to your doctor and/or nurse so they can help you manage them.
Radiation can cause early and late side effects. Early side effects happen during or right after treatment. They are typically gone within weeks. Common early side effects include fatigue and skin problems. Skin in the treatment area may become sensitive, red, irritated, or swollen. Other changes include dryness, itching, peeling, and blistering.
Depending on the area under treatment, other early side effects may include: hair loss in the treatment area, mouth problems and difficulty swallowin, eating and digestion problems, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, headaches, soreness and swelling in the treatment area, urinary and bladder changes. 
Late side effects may occur months or years following treatment. While they are often permanent, they are rare. They include: brain changes, 	spinal cord changes, lung changes, kidney changes, colon and rectal changes, infertility, joint changes, lymphedema, mouth changes, and secondary cancer.
There is a slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. After treatment, your radiation oncologist will regularly check for complications and recurrent or new cancers.
IGRT allows doctors to maximize the cancer-destroying capabilities of radiation treatment. At the same time, it allows them to minimize its effect on healthy tissues and any treatment side effects."
How effective is modern radiation treatment of colorectal cancer?,"Surgery is the most effective way to treat colorectal cancer. Radiation therapy is most effective as an additional or adjuvant therapy either before or after surgery. It reduces the chance of cancer spread or recurrence.

Doctors do not normally use radiation as the only ""definitive"" treatment for colorectal cancer. They usually provide it in combination with chemotherapy to help the radiation work better. Patients may receive chemotherapy intravenously or orally."
What happens during radiation therapy of  colorectal cancer? ,"Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles. At high doses—much higher than x-ray exams use—it can destroy abnormal cells that cause cancer. It does this by damaging the cell's DNA, which eventually causes the cell to die.

Because of the importance of treating the cancer but sparing healthy tissue, you will visit the medical center before actual therapy for treatment planning and simulation. The best patient positions for radiation exposure are determined for accurate, effective therapeutic results. The doctor may mark your skin with permanent ink. They may create customized lead shields to protect healthy organs or shape the radiation fields for your situation using special blocks inside the radiation machine. CT or MRI scans may help better visualize the tumor and the sensitive normal tissues and aid in treatment planning."
"What are the possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in colorectal cancer cancer?","Side effects that develop during treatment vary from person to person. However, some side effects are typical.

There are usually no immediate side effects from each radiation treatment. Most patients gradually develop mild fatigue over the course of therapy. This slowly goes away one to two months following treatment. Some patients develop some redness, dryness, and itching of the skin after a few weeks. Other patients develop substantial irritation.

Skin reactions usually heal completely within a few weeks of completing treatment.

Diarrhea, frequent bowel movements, or appetite loss is likely to occur at some point during the course of treatment. Generally, side effects stop gradually once treatment ceases, but bowel function may remain different from what it was before the disease started."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for radiation therapy of colorectal cancer?,"Colorectal cancer can recur, or reappear, in a patient previously treated for the disease. Because patients can sometimes be cured after their tumor recurs, follow-up care is critically important.

Physical exam. Patients will undergo frequent physical exams from a few weeks to many years after treatment. This is especially true if treatment side effects do not go away or new symptoms develop. Pain, unexplained weight loss, or bleeding can occur with tumor recurrence.
Blood tests. Follow-up evaluation usually includes blood tests. An abnormal result may indicate that the colorectal cancer is back.
Colonoscopy. About one year after treatment, patients usually undergo colonoscopy to detect recurrence or development of new benign or malignant masses. If exam findings are normal, it should be repeated three years later, then every five years after that.
Imaging. Also during follow-up exams, a patient may undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT and/or MRI can help determine treatment response and detect disease spread. Occasionally, your doctor may use positron emission tomography (PET) to detect disease spread. However, they will normally only use PET when other symptoms are present.."
What happens during radiation therapy of esophageal cancer? ,"Prior to beginning radiation therapy, some patients who cannot swallow may have a feeding tube inserted into their esophagus. This tube, called an esophageal stent, allows the esophagus to remain open.

The treatment process for external beam therapy begins with simulation and treatment planning.

The goal of simulation is to determine the patient's daily treatment position and to make devices that will help the patient maintain that position. Body molds, head masks, or other devices may be constructed to help the patient stay still during treatment and temporary skin marks or tattoos may also be applied to help precisely position the patient for each treatment session.

For treatment planning, computed tomography (CT), position emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images will be obtained to map the location of the cancer and healthy tissues nearby. Using these images and sophisticated treatment planning tools, a team of professionals including a dosimetrist, radiation physicist and radiation oncologist generate a treatment plan that will deliver the appropriate radiation dose to the tumor while minimizing exposure to surrounding normal tissues.

After the simulation and planning have been completed, the treatment can begin.

External beam therapy with high energy x-rays is often delivered from a machine called a linear accelerator. Various techniques are used to deliver EBT, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT).

3-D CRT more precisely conforms the radiation to the tumor, allowing a higher radiation dose to be safely delivered.
IMRT uses special devices called collimators to regulate the intensity of the radiation beams, allowing different areas of a tumor and nearby tissues to receive different doses of radiation.
IGRT is often used in conjunction with IMRT to deliver precise radiation doses to a malignant tumor or even specific areas within the tumor.
External beam radiation therapy can also be delivered using beams of a charged particle called a proton, which are typically generated by a machine called a cyclotron.

Before each radiation therapy session, the patient may be asked to change into a gown. The patient is then placed on the treatment couch in exactly the same position that was used for simulation using the immobilization devices. The therapist goes outside the room and turns on the linear accelerator from outside.

Patients undergo radiation therapy during a series of outpatient treatments over several weeks. The patient's diagnosis determines the total duration of treatment. Each treatment session lasts less than an hour, most of which is spent positioning the patient."
"What are the possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in esophageal cancer?","Radiation treatment can cause side effects. These problems may result from the treatment itself or from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area.
The number and severity of side effects will depend on the type of radiation, dose, and body part under treatment. Talk to your doctor and/or nurse so they can help manage them.
Radiation can cause early and late side effects. Early side effects happen during or right after treatment. They are typically gone within a few weeks. Common early side effects include fatigue and skin problems. Skin in the treatment area may become sensitive, red, irritated, or swollen. Other changes include dryness, itching, peeling, and blistering.

Depending on the area being treated, other early side effects may include:
hair loss in the treatment area, mouth problems and difficulty swallowing, eating and digestion problems, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, headaches, soreness and swelling in the treatment area,
urinary and bladder changes,   Late side effects may occur months or years following treatment. While they are often permanent, they are rare. They include:
brain changes, spinal cord changes, lung changes, kidney changes, colon and rectal changes, infertility, joint changes, lymphedema, mouth changes, secondary cancer.
There is a slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. After treatment, your radiation oncologist will regularly check for complications and recurrent or new cancers.

Individuals undergoing radiation therapy may experience early or acute side effects during the course of treatment. They may also experience chronic or late side effects months or even years after they have completed treatment. Side effects vary from individual to individual and may depend on one's general health, the area of the body undergoing treatment, the daily radiation dose, the total radiation dose given during treatment and other treatments (such as chemotherapy) they may be undergoing at the same time.

Patients undergoing external beam radiation treatment typically experience difficult and painful swallowing soon after starting treatment. This occurs as a result of the radiation killing the cells in the lining of the esophagus, which causes a reaction similar to a sunburn. It is important for patients to drink plenty of water and to meet their nutritional needs during this time. When patients cannot get adequate nutrition and hydration, a feeding tube may need to be inserted before or during radiation treatment until the patient regains the ability to swallow. Once treatment is completed, the pain usually subsides within a few weeks.

Other common side effects of radiation therapy include:
fatigue, skin changes, including dryness, itching, peeling, and blistering, diarrhea, dry mouth and other mouth problems, extreme fatigue, nausea (especially if the abdomen is treated), inflammation in the treated area, such as difficulty with swallowing, a cough or feeling short of breath as a result of radiation to the chest, pain with or difficulty swallowing, decreased blood cell counts, which can lead to increased fatigue, an increased risk of infection and bruising, loss of hair in the treatment area. Most of these side effects go away within two months after radiation therapy is finished.

Late or long-term side effects may occur six or more months after radiation therapy is completed. Whether or not a patient experiences late side effects depends on the area of the body treated with radiation therapy, other aspects of their cancer treatment and individual risk factors. Radiation therapy for esophageal cancer may cause a stricture (narrowing) in the esophagus, which may require further treatment. Other possible long-term side effects include: fibrosis (the replacement of normal tissue with scar tissue, leading to restricted movement of the affected area),
damage to the bowels, causing diarrhea and bleeding, infertility, heart or lung damage from radiation therapy to the chest, possibly leading to problems breathing and shortness of breath.
thyroid problems or irritation of the esophagus from radiation to the neck, headaches and problems with memory loss, personality changes and trouble concentrating from radiation to the head
the development of another cancer later in life, called secondary cancer, Patients should talk to their doctor before and during treatment about the side effects they can expect and ways to minimize them."
How effective is modern radiation treatment of lung cancer?,"It is extremely important to remember that “inoperable” does not mean “incurable” when it comes to lung cancer. In fact, an increasing number of patients are being treated with a non-surgical approach across all stages of this disease. Treatment effectiveness depends on the stage of disease. In early stage inoperable disease that is treated with radiotherapy alone, control of the local disease is typical. In more advanced disease, a combination of chemotherapy and radiation is delivered with curative intent. Cure rates are lower but still possible with disease spread to the lymph nodes within the chest. The medical or radiation oncologist may propose a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for a patient who is otherwise well.

When cure is not a possibility, doctors recommend palliative treatment. This is the use of medications, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other measures to relieve symptoms of lung cancer without eliminating the tumor. The doctor will use smaller doses of radiation therapy to avoid side effects. At some point, if you and your oncologist or primary care physician agree that active treatment is no longer advisable, hospice care can provide comfort and support.

Pain relief is a very important part of treating lung cancer. Although many effective treatments are available, and there are devices for delivering medication on demand without overdosing, many cancer patients still do not receive adequate pain relief. When the needs of the patient are clearly expressed, doctors can better provide appropriate care."
What happens during radiation therapy of lung cancer? ,"Radiation therapy delivers focused high-energy x-rays (photons), gamma rays, or atomic particles. It affects cells that are rapidly dividing—such as cancer cells—much more than those that are not. Most cancers, including lung tumors, are made of cells that divide more rapidly than those in normal lung tissue. This means the tumor may be eliminated without damaging surrounding normal tissues. Radiotherapy acts by attacking the DNA within tumor cells, making it impossible for them to grow and create more cancer cells. Normal body cells may also be damaged, but they are able to repair themselves and function properly once again. The key is to give daily doses of radiation large enough to kill a high percentage of the rapidly dividing cancer cells, while minimizing damage to the more slowly dividing normal tissue cells in the same area."
"What are the possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in lung cancer?","Overall, radiotherapy is a local treatment. Any side effects usually happen in the parts of the body where radiation passes through. Radiotherapy usually does not damage normal organs outside the path of the treatment beam.
Most patients tire easily during their course of radiation treatment. This fatigue occurs two to three weeks after treatment starts and gradually increases as treatment continues. It may become severe and seriously limit your ability to engage in normal daily activities. Typically, fatigue lessens one to two months after radiotherapy is completed. If you experience fatigue, it is important to get enough rest. However, at the same time, your doctor may suggest that you stay as active as possible.
Some patients experience hair loss on the chest included in the radiation field. Depending on how much radiation is delivered, this may be temporary or permanent.
Skin irritation is common after a few weeks of radiation therapy. The affected area may be red, dry, tender, and itchy. This reaction can become quite severe during a long course of treatment. It helps to keep the skin clean with gentle soap and warm water, to dry it well, and to avoid very hot water while bathing. Sunscreen should be used when skin in the treated area is exposed to sunlight. Do not use perfumes, cosmetics, or deodorants in the treatment area. After daily treatments, you may apply an unscented cream or lotion.
Temporary loss of appetite is a possibility.
Esophagitis or inflammation of the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) is common if radiotherapy is directed at the lymph nodes in the central chest or if the tumor is near the esophagus. This condition can be severe. The esophagus is very sensitive to radiation, and the symptoms are worse in patients who also receive chemotherapy. Esophagitis can make it difficult to swallow, and some patients need intravenous (IV) pain medication or fluids to get through the full course of radiation treatment. Some people experience esophagitis as the sensation of a lump or discomfort before it becomes overtly painful. Some foods (such as spicy or acidic foods or bread) feel worse than others. It is important to remember that although certain foods may cause pain with swallowing, they will not cause damage. Avoid foods that cause pain until about one month after the final day of radiation. The inflammation generally plateaus toward the end of treatment and starts to resolve within two to three weeks after treatment in most patients.
An inflammation of the lungs called radiation pneumonitis may develop three to six months after radiotherapy is over. It causes coughing and shortness of breath as well as fever. In most cases, it calls for no specific treatment and gets better within two to four weeks. It can occasionally happen earlier and require steroids and/or oxygen.
Decrease in a specific type of white blood cell called lymphocytes is another side effect of radiotherapy."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for radiation therapy of lung cancer?,"Once radiotherapy ends, your doctor will want to see you after four to six weeks and then every three to six months for the first two years. After this, you may see the doctor every six months for three years and then once a year. Your medical or radiation oncologist will often prescribe a computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This will take place about four to eight weeks after treatment ends, when the response is expected to be the greatest. These images will help to assess response and make it possible to do comparisons with earlier images. It also allows your doctor to find treatment-related complications at an early stage. Imaging can tell the difference between recurrent cancer and lung scars produced by high-dose radiation treatment. By obtaining chest imaging on a regular basis, (generally no more than two to four times per year), recurrent cancers may be discovered in time to be successfully re-treated.

In addition to x-rays, other tests such as blood cell counts and bronchoscopy may be a routine part of the follow-up exam. Your doctor may use other tests to follow up on symptoms or findings on chest imaging. If new symptoms develop in another part of the body, your doctor may test to detect any potential problem.

After treatment, the tumor may be gone (cured). Or it can regrow in an area of the original tumor (recur) or remain after treatment (residual tumor). Patients who have had one cancer may develop a second, unrelated primary lung cancer. This happens to about 3 percent of patients per year."
How effective is modern radiation treatment of pancreatic cancer?,"With modern technology and recent advances in treatment software, physicians can deliver more of the radiation dose directly to the tumor while avoiding healthy tissue nearby. Doctors use 3-D imaging techniques to visualize the area of the body being treated and surrounding tissue so that the radiation dose can be precisely targeted at the diseased cells. Both stereotactic body radiotherapy and proton therapy help minimize the radiation dose that is delivered to healthy tissue, reducing the risk of side effects and complications. The goal of treatment today is to safely provide radiation, reduce pain and extend life."
What happens during radiation therapy of pancreatic cancer? ,Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles (protons). Radiation at high doses can destroy abnormal cells at the microscopic level. Patients will hear some electrical noise and see lights on the machine but will not feel the radiation during treatment. Radiation treatment is typically given to patients in multiple sessions over a course of weeks.
"What are the possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer?","After multiple radiation therapy sessions, patients often become tired. While adequate rest is important, doctors usually advise patients to try to stay as active as possible. Patients may have an upset stomach, diarrhea or loose stools, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite while being treated with radiation therapy. Sometimes patients will have skin changes or irritation in the area where the radiation beam enters the body. Patients may also experience low levels of red blood cells and/or white blood cells, increasing their risk of infection. These side effects are generally short term, lasting two to three weeks after treatment."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for radiation therapy of pancreatic cancer?,"Once your pancreatic cancer treatment is complete, you and your treatment team will decide on a follow-up plan. Patients with early stage cancers and neuroendocrine tumors will typically follow up with a medical oncologist or family doctor every six months for the two years after treatment and then every year after. All pancreatic cancer patients will need to have regular blood tests. If the pancreas no longer functions properly or has been removed, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and insulin treatment may be required. Living with cancer can be emotionally difficult for you and your loved ones. Finding a therapist who specializes in treating cancer patients is highly recommended."
What happens during radiation therapy for breast cancer?,Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles. When radiation is used at therapeutic doses (many times those used for x-ray imaging exams) it can destroy abnormal cells that cause cancer and other illnesses.
"What are possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in breast cancer?","There are usually no immediate side effects from each radiation treatment given to the breast. Patients do not develop nausea or hair loss on the head from radiation therapy to the breast.

Most patients develop mild fatigue that builds up gradually over the course of therapy. This slowly goes away one to two months following the radiation therapy. Most patients develop dull aches or sharp shooting pains in the breast that may last for a few seconds or minutes. It is rare for patients to need any medication for this. The most common side effect needing attention is skin reaction. Most patients develop reddening, dryness and itching of the skin after a few weeks. Some patients develop substantial irritation.

Skin care recommendations include:

Keeping the skin clean using gentle soap and warm but not hot water
Avoiding extreme temperatures while bathing
Avoiding trauma to the skin and sun exposure (use clothing as a barrier or a sunscreen with at least SPF 30)
Avoiding shaving the treatment area with a razor blade (use an electric razor if necessary)
Avoiding use of perfumes, cosmetics, after-shave or deodorants in the treatment area (use cornstarch with or without baking soda in place of deodorants)
Using only recommended unscented creams or lotions after daily treatment
Some patients develop a sunburn-like reaction with blistering and peeling of the skin, called ""moist desquamation."" This usually occurs in the fold under the breast or in the fold between the breast and the arm, or sometimes in the area given a radiation boost. Most people with a limited area of moist desquamation can continue treatment without interruption. Sometimes, topical medications (those applied to the surface of the body) are prescribed. When treatment must be interrupted, the skin usually heals enough to allow radiation to be resumed in five to seven days. Skin reactions usually heal completely within a few weeks of completing radiotherapy.

Minor complications include:

Slight swelling of the breast during radiotherapy. This usually goes away within six to 12 months.
The skin becomes darker during the course of radiotherapy, similar to tanning from the sun. In most cases, this also fades gradually over six to 12 months.
Most women will have aches or pains from time to time in the treated breast or the muscles surrounding the breast, even years after treatment. The reason why this happens is not clear; however, these pains are harmless, although annoying. They are not usually a sign that the cancer is reappearing.
Rarely, patients may develop a rib fracture years following treatment. This occurs in less than one percent of patients treated by modern approaches. These heal slowly by themselves.
More serious complications include:

Radiation therapy given to the axillary lymph nodes can increase the risk of patients developing arm swelling (""lymphedema"") following axillary (armpit) dissection.
Radiation therapy given to the axillary lymph nodes may rarely cause numbness, tingling or even pain and loss of strength in the hand and arm years after treatment.
Some patients develop ""radiation pneumonitis,"" a lung reaction that causes a cough, shortness of breath and fevers three to nine months after completing treatment. Fortunately, it is usually mild enough that no specific treatment is needed and it goes away within two to four weeks with no long-term complications.
Radiotherapy may damage the heart. Fortunately, modern radiation techniques treat much less of the heart than treatments used in the past. Current studies have found no increased risk of serious heart disease in patients treated with modern techniques even 10 to 20 years after radiotherapy treatment was given. However, there is still some uncertainty about the risks of radiation causing heart disease for individuals who smoke or have pre-existing heart disease, or for those who receive certain chemotherapy drugs. It is likely that such risks will also be found to be very small. Fortunately, newer radiation techniques treat patients in the prone position (patient lying on their stomach, pulling the breast away from the heart) or use deep inspiration technique (taking a deep breath and pulling the chest away from the heart during radiation therapy). Both techniques may further reduce radiation related heart injury.
Women age 45 or younger at the time of treatment may have a slightly increased risk (by a few percent at most) of developing cancer of the other breast with time, compared with the risk they would have if they did not undergo radiation. There is a very small risk (perhaps one in 1,000 individuals) that cancers may develop five, 10, 20 or more years later in the skin, muscle, bone or lung directly in the area of treatment.
Patients may rarely develop a breakdown of the skin or such severe pain in the breast that surgery is needed for treatment."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for radiation therapy of breast cancer?,"The major goal of follow-up is, if possible, to detect and treat recurrences in the irradiated breast or lymph nodes and new cancers developing later in either breast before they can spread to other parts of the body. The routine use of bone scans, chest x-rays, blood tests and other tests to detect the possible spread to other organs in patients without symptoms does not appear to be useful. Your physician will determine a follow-up schedule for you. This may include a physical exam every few months for the first several years after treatment and then every six to 12 months or so after that. Annual follow-up mammograms are an important part of your care. If symptoms or clinical circumstances suggest a recurrence, diagnostic tests such as blood tests, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest x-ray (CXR), or bone scan may be needed."
How effective is modern radiation treatment of anal cancer?,"Anal cancer is generally responsive to radiation therapy. Chemotherapy further improves upon the efficacy of radiation therapy. Recent improvements in radiation therapy also allow for improved sparing of normal tissues. Ultimately, however, the effectiveness of treatment is dependent on the stage of the cancer and your cancer's specific response to treatment."
What happens during radiation therapy for anal cancer ?,"Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles. When radiation is used at high doses—much higher than the amount used to obtain x-ray images—it can destroy abnormal cells that cause cancer. It does this by damaging the cell's DNA, which eventually causes the cell to die.

Because of the importance of treating the cancer but sparing healthy tissue, you will visit the medical center before actual therapy for treatment planning and simulation. Correct patient positions for radiation exposure are determined for accurate, effective therapeutic results. Your skin may be marked with permanent ink. Custom-made lead shields may be constructed to protect your healthy organs from the radiation, or the radiation fields may be shaped for your situation with special blocks inside the radiation machine. CT or MRI scans may be used to better represent the tumor and the sensitive normal tissues for treatment planning.

External beam therapy (EBT) with high energy x-rays is often delivered from a machine called a linear accelerator. Patients undergo EBT during a series of outpatient treatments over several weeks. The patient's diagnosis determines the total duration of treatment. Each treatment session lasts less than an hour, most of which is spent positioning the patient."
"What are possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in anal cancer?","Side effects of radiation treatment include problems that occur as a result of the treatment itself as well as from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area.

The number and severity of side effects you may experience will depend on the type of radiation and dosage you receive and the part of your body being treated. You should talk to your doctor and nurse about any side effects you experience so they can help you manage them.

Radiation therapy can cause early and late side effects. Early side effects occur during or immediately after treatment and are typically gone within a few weeks. Common early side effects of radiation therapy include tiredness or fatigue and skin problems. Skin in the treatment area may become more sensitive, red, irritated, or swollen. Other skin changes include dryness, itching, peeling and blistering.

Depending on the area being treated, other early side effects may include:
temporary anal irritation and pain, discomfort during bowel movements, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, in women, irritation to the vagina, including discomfort and drainage.

Late side effects, which are rare, occur months or years following treatment and are often permanent. They include:
damage to anal tissue and the formation of scar tissue, changes to the anal sphincter, risk of fractures in the pelvis or hip, damage to the blood vessels in the lining of the rectum, causing inflammation, rectal bleeding and pain, infertility, vaginal dryness and the formation of scar tissue in the vagina, abnormal swelling in the legs, called lymphedema.
There is a slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. Following radiation treatment for cancer, you should be checked on a regular basis by your radiation oncologist for recurring and new cancers."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for radiation therapy of anal cancer?,"After your treatment has ended, your physician will want to watch you closely for a recurrence of cancer and to monitor your treatment-related side effects. Follow-up appointments, which may be scheduled every three months for two years, may include:

a physical examination, including a rectal exam, and questions about any problems or symptoms you are experiencing
blood tests
imaging tests, such as x-rays or a computed tomography (CT) scan"
"What happens during radiation therapy for brain cancer?
","For conventional radiation therapy, you will consult with a radiation oncologist —a doctor who specializes in radiation therapy. During the first visit, the oncologist will review the history of your illness and perform a physical exam. You may consult with other members of your treatment team at this time, too.

After you and your doctor(s) decide on a course of treatment, you will begin treatment planning. During this first treatment planning phase, a radiation oncologist will simulate your radiation therapy treatment using either conventional x-rays or a CT scan. Most cases will require an MRI scan. Doctors use these exams to plan the type and direction of radiation beams they will use to treat the cancer.

You will need to lie still on the treatment table during simulation, although no radiation therapy will be given at that point. The treatment team will usually create an immobilization mask at this time to prevent head movement. Typically, treatment begins one to two weeks after your treatment planning session. Planning and verifying your treatment plan will require significant medical physics before you begin treatment.

During your actual radiation therapy treatment, you will lie on the treatment table without moving. A radiation technologist will administer the treatment prescribed by the radiation oncologist. The treatment will last only a few minutes, and you may see flashes of light or smell an odor during that time. You may also hear a noise from the treatment unit. If you undergo stereotactic radiosurgery, you may wear a rigid head frame. In this procedure, a CT or MRI scan will help the doctor pinpoint tumor location, and a computer will regulate the needed radiation dose. They doctor may take multiple images on the treatment machine to ensure everything is well aligned.

Treatment planning sessions and your first radiation therapy treatments may take up to an hour. After that, treatments will usually last a few minutes and you will be in and out of the radiation department in 30 to 45 minutes for each session. Typically, treatments are given once a day, three to five days a week, for five to seven weeks. Treatments are usually not given on weekends.

For more information about specific radiation therapy procedures and equipment, visit the following pages:"
"What are possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in brain cancer?","The side effects of radiation therapy to the brain may not occur until two to three weeks after the start of your therapy. Many people experience hair loss, but the amount varies from person to person. Hair may grow back once therapy is finished.

Skin irritation is the second most frequently reported side effect. The skin around your ears and scalp may become dry, itchy, red, or tender. Do not try to treat this side effect on your own. Seek professionalism medical treatment as soon as it occurs. Fatigue is another possible side effect. The best way to fight fatigue is to get on a daily exercise regimen that is tolerable and sustainable, eat a healthy diet, and rely on friends and family for support. Your normal energy levels should return about six weeks after you finish your therapy. Fatigue may be the worst two to three weeks after you complete prolonged (multi-week) radiation treatment

Edema (swelling of the brain) is also a common side effect. Tell your oncologist if you have a headache or a feeling of pressure. The doctor may prescribe medications to help reduce brain swelling, prevent seizures, or control pain. If you receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy at the same time, you may experience more severe side effects. Your doctor can suggest ways to ease these symptoms.

Other possible side effects include:
hearing problems, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, memory or speech problems, headaches.

Radiation is a powerful weapon against cancer cells, but sometimes it kills healthy brain tissue as well. This severe side effect is called radiation necrosis. Necrosis (a late effect of high doses of radiation) can cause headaches, seizures, or even death in a small number of cases. This can occur six months to a few years after treatment. However, there is less risk of necrosis today because of newer, targeted radiation therapies and the emergence of powerful imaging, brain mapping and information technologies.

Other complications include:
neurologic deficits (this usually depends on the area of the brain being treated), cognitive problems, seizures, headaches, return of tumor growth, In children, radiation may damage the pituitary gland and other parts of the brain. This could cause learning problems or slow growth and development. Additionally, radiation during childhood increases the risk of developing tumors later in life. Researchers are studying chemotherapy as an alternative to radiation therapy in children with brain tumors."
"What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for radiation therapy of brain cancer?

","Regular follow-up treatment is extremely important after brain tumor treatment. Besides regular physical and neurological exams and blood tests, you may need periodic MRI, MR spectroscopy, perfusion or diffusion MRI, and/or CT exams. Doctors rarely use  positron emission tomography (PET) scans in brain tumor patients. However, they may use PET to monitor disease outside of the brain (extracranial disease). Your doctor may also recommend home care, occupational or vocational therapy, pain management, physical therapy, and participation in support groups.

This follow-up care will help your doctor to:

spot any sign that the tumor is returning, monitor the health of your brain, identify and treat the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, detect the presence of other types of cancer at the earliest possible stage."
How effective is modern radiation treatment of cervical cancer?,"Modern technology and recent advances in treatment software allow doctors to deliver more of the radiation dose directly to the cervix and avoid surrounding healthy tissue. Doctors use various imaging techniques to visualize the cervix and surrounding tissue in three dimensions. This allows the radiation dose to be tailored more precisely to the individual patient's unique needs. Improved brachytherapy devices help minimize the radiation dose that will be delivered near the bladder and rectum. This reduces the risk of side effects and complications. The goal of treatment today is to safely provide a higher dose of radiation, to improve the chances of a cure."
What happens during radiation therapy for cervical cancer ?,"Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays (photons). Used at high doses (many times those used for x-ray imaging exams), it can destroy cancer cells with each treatment. This happens at a microscopic level. Patients do not feel the radiation during treatment. They will only hear some electrical noise from the machine and may notice safety warning lights in the room."
"What are possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in cervical cancer?

","As treatment progresses, you may become tired. Adequate rest is important, you should try to stay as active as you can. You may have upset stomach, diarrhea or loose stools (if radiation is given to the pelvis or abdomen), nausea and vomiting during EBT. Some patients will have skin changes or irritation in the area where the radiation has passed through the skin to the cancer. If the irritation leads to peeling, you must be careful to clean and protect the area to avoid infection.

Other side effects from EBT include:  Radiation cystitis: irritation to the bladder, causing an urge to urinate often; Vaginal pain: increased sensitivity and soreness in the vagina, which can also result in discharge; Menstrual changes: radiation to the pelvis can affect the ovaries and often result in menstrual changes or early menopause.
Low blood counts: radiation can affect how your body is functioning overall. This can result in low levels of red blood cells and/or white blood cells.
Women undergoing brachytherapy often see similar side effects to those associated with EBT. These may include fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, irritation of the bladder and low blood counts. Also, because the radiation used in brachytherapy only travels a short distance, the vagina and the vulva may become red and sore and have a discharge. Patients often receive brachytherapy and EBT close together. This may make it more difficult to tell which treatment is causing the side effects.

These side effects generally last two to three weeks after treatment is over. However, there are some long-term side effects that may or may not resolve.
Vaginal stenosis: Both EBT and brachytherapy can cause scar tissue to form in the vagina. The scar tissue can make the vagina narrower (called stenosis), less able to stretch, or shorter. This can make sexual intercourse painful.
Vaginal dryness: Vaginal dryness can be a long-term side effect from both EBT and brachytherapy. Estrogen creams are often used to help improve the dryness, especially if the radiation treatment results in early menopause. Irregular bowel movements that may be more frequent or urgent; Bowel obstruction that could require surgery to fix; Bladder damage that could cause bleeding in the urine.
Weakened bones: Radiation to the pelvis can weaken the bones. This can put a woman at high risk of fractures. Hip fractures are the most common fracture seen in women, typically within the first few years after radiation. Bone density tests are recommended to monitor this risk. See the Bone Density Scan page for more information.
Swelling of the leg(s): If pelvic lymph nodes are treated with radiation, it can lead to fluid drainage problems in the leg. Some women experience swelling in the leg, a condition called lymphedema. Non-invasive treatments for lymphedema are available.
Early menopause and infertility: Radiation therapy is likely to cause early menopause and permanent infertility. Women of child-bearing age who may be pregnant or wish to become pregnant should talk to their doctors. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of hormone-replacement therapy as well."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for radiation therapy of cervical cancer?,"Once treatment is complete, you and your treatment team will decide on a follow-up plan. Early stage cancers will likely require follow up with your gynecologist oncologist. These appointments should be done every three months for the next two years and every six months for the following three years. Exams are performed annually thereafter. You will also need to have an annual pap smear test (including patients who have had a hysterectomy). Patients with more advanced cancer will need to be followed by both your gynecologist oncologist and radiation oncologist. These appointments will start within weeks of finishing your treatment to address any side effects. Once it is determined that the treatment has worked, your visits will be spaced further apart. At these visits, your doctor may order PET or CT scans. See the PET/CT Scan page for more information."
what happens during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer?,"The initial visit to the radiation oncologist is for a consultation, when the radiation oncologist will listen to the history of your problem and perform a physical examination. Consultations with other members of the head and neck team, such as the head and neck surgeon, medical oncologist, pathologist, radiologist and dentist, usually take place at this time or shortly after. It is important to have the input of various members of the team who will be taking care of you before a treatment plan is decided and treatment begins.

After the recommended treatment and possible options are explained to you and you decide on a course of treatment in conjunction with your doctors, a date will be selected for treatment planning for radiation therapy (if radiation therapy has been selected as the first or next step in your treatment). You then have what is called a ""simulation"" using either conventional radiographs (x-rays) or a computed tomography (CT) scan. These radiographic studies are used to plan the type and direction of radiation beams used to treat the cancer. Customized lead alloy blocks or a special collimator (multileaf collimator) in the treatment machine will shape the radiation beams to block areas that do not need to be treated. Treatment fields then will be aligned, and the treatment course will start one to two weeks after the initial treatment-planning session. There is significant medical physics involvement in the planning and verification of the plan before it is actually delivered to the patient.

Typically, treatments are given once or twice a day, five days a week for five to seven weeks, depending on the treatment schedule selected by your radiation oncologist. Generally, for the first couple of days of treatment planning and treatment start, your visit to the radiation oncology department may take an hour or two. Thereafter, each individual treatment takes a shorter amount of time, which varies depending on the complexity of the set-up. You will not feel or see anything during a radiation treatment, although the machine makes a sound that may be heard during the treatment."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer?,"The side effects depend on the site and extent of the head and neck cancer and whether it is done in conjunction with chemotherapy. In general, radiation therapy of the head and neck does not cause nausea, but a few patients do experience nausea during treatment. Many effective antiemetics (drugs that alleviate nausea) can relieve this symptom if it should occur. Chemotherapy will cause its own side effects which will be discussed with the medical oncologist.

Generally, the side effects of radiation therapy become apparent about two weeks into the treatment course, when a sore throat, loss of taste sensation, dryness of the mouth and dry skin reactions may occur. Sore throat is the main side effect that makes the course of radiation therapy difficult.

If your sore throat is severe, you may be unable to take in enough food and liquids by mouth to maintain your weight or avoid dehydration. Your doctors will then insert a feeding tube temporarily into your stomach (a gastrostomy tube), which will allow you to maintain adequate nutrition without having to swallow all of the food that you need. Gastrostomy placement is usually an outpatient procedure. It is important, though, to continue swallowing even with a gastrostomy tube in place. Otherwise, your swallowing muscles may weaken; this would cause permanent swallowing problems and make it difficult to stop using the gastrostomy tube even after the radiation treatment course is completed.

A dietitian should be involved in your care during the course of radiation treatments to help you maintain adequate caloric intake and hydration. When side effects occur, it may be tempting to take a break from treatments. This is not a good idea. The ""acutely responding"" normal tissues—such as the skin and the lining of the throat—that are responsible for the side effects during radiation therapy tend to respond to radiation as do cancer cells. If the treatment produces few acute side effects, it is also not likely to be very effective against the cancer. Therefore, the treatment of most head and neck cancers represents a classic ""no pain, no gain"" situation. Breaks in the treatment course to lessen the side effects give the cancer a chance to regrow and will significantly reduce the likelihood of cure. Medications that are almost always needed during a course of radiation therapy include pain medicines, analgesic ""magic mouthwash"" for the sore throat to help swallowing, possibly antiemetics if nausea is a problem and possibly stool softeners to counteract some pain medication effects."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for head and neck cancer?,"There are several reasons for follow-up examinations:

    To detect recurrent cancer and possibly try further treatment, such as an operation, if the radiation therapy is unsuccessful
    To treat the acute side effects of the radiation therapy
    To detect and treat late side effects or complications from the radiation therapy, should they occur
    To detect and treat additional, unrelated head and neck cancers that may arise

If the initial treatment for the cancer is successful and you are cured, there is still a relatively low risk (2 percent to 3 percent per year) of developing a new, completely unrelated head and neck cancer. Per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, follow-up examinations usually take place:

    Every one to three months for the first year
    Every two months to six months for the second year
    Every four to eight months for the years three through five
    Annually thereafter

Thyroid functions are often checked annually to detect any occurrence of hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function), which is easily treatable.

Continued imaging follow-up is typically performed both to assess the response to treatment and to monitor for disease recurrence. CT scans are most commonly performed for this purpose, however, MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may also be performed in certain situations.

Dental exams for oral cavity and sites exposed to significant intraoral radiation treatment."
What are possible  risks and complications of radiation therapy in head and neck cancer?,"A clear goal of treatment must be determined for each patient before therapy starts. The first question is often whether the goal of treatment is cure or, instead, the lessening (palliation) of symptoms associated with an incurable cancer. If cure is unlikely, then potential risks associated with treatment may be less than those associated with a potentially curative course of radiation therapy. However in head and neck cancer the planned radiation to achieve long term palliation may be the same as the curative course.

Palliative courses of treatment generally entail giving a moderate dose of radiation over a short time. This provides a relatively high chance of shrinking the tumor and lessening symptoms while exposing the patient to less risk of side effects and complications, and requiring a relatively brief time to complete the therapy. A typical course of palliative radiation treatments would be divided into 10 treatments given over two weeks.

On the other hand, if there is a reasonable chance of cure (the definition of reasonable can vary, depending on the situation, but generally at least 5 percent to 10 percent), then a longer and more arduous course of treatment is generally planned. The risks associated with treatment depend on the location and extent of the tumor and the normal structures that are nearby.

In general, for any type of treatment, the treating physician tries to estimate the potential risk of a major complication; if this risk is similar to or exceeds the anticipated likelihood of cure, then the treatment plan is modified. However, if the likelihood of cure is significantly greater than the risk of a major complication, then treatment is initiated."
What happens during radiation treatment for thyroid cancer?,"Doctors use two types of radiation for thyroid cancer patients: 
You will swallow a capsule or pill that contains radioactive iodine (I-131). Both healthy and cancerous thyroid cells absorb the I-131, which destroys them. This treatment is usually given in a hospital. You may stay overnight. During the treatment and for a short period after, you will give off radiation. Your doctor will tell you how to protect your family, friends and pets at home. See the Radioactive Iodine Therapy page for more information. 
External Beam Therapy (EBT): EBT begins with treatment planning using either x-rays or a computed tomography (CT) scan. These exams help plan the type and direction of radiation beams to treat the cancer. Each treatment will last a few minutes each day, although it may take longer to get you set up. Once the radiation starts, you will hear some electrical noise and see warning lights from the machine. Patients do not feel the radiation during treatment."
"What are possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in Thyroid cancer?","Radioactive iodine (I-131): Patients generally tolerate this treatment well. Short-term side effects include tenderness and swelling around the thyroid, nausea, swelling of the salivary glands, dry mouth, and sometimes changes in how things taste. Some patients find they are unable to make tears, leading to dry eyes and problems with contact lenses. Less frequent side effects include a lower sperm count in men and irregular periods in women. Women should avoid becoming pregnant for 6-12 months after treatment. Patients who have had I-131 treatment may have a slightly higher risk of developing leukemia in the future. This is extremely rare.
External beam therapy (EBT): After several EBT sessions, patients may become tired. Getting adequate rest is important. Doctors usually advise patients to try to stay as active as they can. Patients may have skin changes or irritation in the neck area where the radiation has passed through the skin. Other side effects include trouble swallowing, dry mouth, and hoarseness. Most of these side effects are easy to manage and go away once treatment ends."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for thyroid cancer?,"After your thyroid cancer treatment is complete, you and your treatment team will decide on a follow-up plan. You may have an annual whole body iodine scan to monitor for any signs of cancer. All thyroid cancer patients will require thyroid replacement hormones. Your doctor will regularly monitor your thyroid levels, including a protein called thyroglobulin (Tg). Tg is made by normal thyroid tissue and abnormal thyroid cancer cells. Once the thyroid is destroyed or removed, your Tg level will be low or zero. Rising levels of Tg may mean your cancer has returned. Your doctor may also use ultrasound exams to ensure no new nodules are forming. Medullary thyroid cancer patients will also have their blood checked for calcitonin and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels. These markers may be the first sign that medullary thyroid cancer has returned. Anaplastic thyroid cancer patients will need to continue seeing both a medical and a radiation oncologist. These appointments start soon after treatment to address any side effects and determine next steps. Your doctor may order CT or PET scans at these visits. See the PET/CT Scan page for more information."
What happens during radiation therapy of Lymphoma cancer?,"Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays. High doses of radiation—much higher than x-ray imaging—can destroy abnormal cells that cause cancer. Radiation damages cancer cells' DNA and eventually causes them to die.
It is important to spare healthy tissue while treating cancer. Radiation planning and design relies on imaging the area to be treated. At the time of ""simulation,"" you will meet a Radiation Therapy Technologist (RTT). The RTT will work with your doctor to determine the correct body position for the best results from the radiation. Once your treatment position is set, you will have a CT scan. The RTT may mark your skin with semi-permanent ink or tiny dot tattoos. Treatment planning may use CT, PET or MRI scans to better localize the tumor and the surrounding healthy tissue. After the simulation, the radiation oncologist will work with other team members (dosimetrist and medical physicist) to design and calculate the best plan for radiation.
Involved field or involved site radiation therapy delivers radiation only to the areas where lymphoma is present. This is the most common type of radiation therapy for lymphoma. You may receive it with chemotherapy. Total nodal irradiation delivers radiation to all the lymph nodes in the body. This immunosuppressive therapy helps facilitate stem cell or organ transplantation. Total body irradiation delivers radiation to the entire body. Stem cell transplant (SCT) patients receive it prior to chemotherapy and transplant. Radiation may relieve symptoms caused by lymphoma that spreads to the brain or spinal cord, puts pressure on nerves, or obstructs organ function."
"What are possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in Lymphoma cancer?","While side effects vary from person to person, some are typical.
Radiation treatments usually have no immediate side effects. Most patients have mild fatigue that builds up gradually over the course of therapy. This slowly goes away one to two months after radiation therapy. Some patients have some reddening, dryness, and itchy skin after a few weeks. Skin reactions usually heal completely within a few weeks of completing treatment.
If you have radiation to the abdomen or pelvis, diarrhea, frequent bowel movements or appetite loss may occur. Medication can ease these side effects. Generally, side effects gradually stop once treatment is complete."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for lymphoma cancer?,"Lymphoma can reappear (recur) in previously treated patients. Because patients can sometimes be cured after their tumor recurs, follow-up care is critically important.
•	Physical exam: You will have physical exams from a few weeks to many years after treatment, especially if side effects do not ease, or new symptoms develop.
•	Blood tests: Your doctor will test your blood periodically to check general organ function and for a lymphoma recurrence.
•	Imaging: During follow-up exams, you may have x-ray, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These images will help assess your response to therapy. They will also look for signs of side effects and whether your cancer is back."
What happens during radiation therapy for prostate cancer?,Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles (protons). High doses of radiation (many times those used for x-ray exams) can destroy abnormal cancer cells. Each treatment destroys some of the cancer cells at a microscopic level. Patients do not feel the radiation during treatment. They will only hear some electrical noise and may see light from the machine.
"What are possible side effects, risks, and complications of radiation therapy in prostate cancer?","Initially, most patients do not have side effects. Radiation side effects build with time. They tend to be worse toward the end of a week and better after the weekend break. As radiation treatment goes on, it may cause you to feel tired. While adequate rest is important, doctors will usually advise you to stay as active as you can. You may have some rectal irritation such as bowel urgency, discomfort, diarrhea, and/or frequent and uncomfortable urination. Also, skin in the treated area may become dry. Redness, tenderness, or hair loss is unusual. 
Radiation therapy can cause impotence in some men at a similar rate as nerve-sparing prostatectomy. Typically, radiation induced impotence will respond to medications to improve erectile function. There is also a small risk of late bladder or rectal problems with radiation. These may appear one to three years after radiation therapy. Your radiation oncologist will monitor you for late complications and check your PSA in your follow-up appointments."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for prostate cancer?,"Patients usually return to see the radiation oncologist about two to eight weeks after the last radiation therapy session. The main purpose of this visit is to see if the side effects from treatment—such as bowel or urinary symptoms—have subsided. In most patients, these symptoms subside in a few weeks. The doctor will check up on you and make sure you make good progress in recovery. After that, you will have regular follow-ups every three to six months. Your doctor may use a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. A blood test will measure your PSA level and assess your response to treatment. Higher PSA levels can indicate the presence of prostate cancer. During follow-up, your doctor can also monitor any late treatment side effects and help manage them.
You may ask the radiation oncologist, “How am I doing? Is the cancer all gone? Am I cured?” However, they cannot answer these questions immediately.  After radiation therapy, it may take months to see your full treatment response. The body gradually disposes of dead cancer cells. Some cancer cells, even if technically dead (they cannot multiply), may continue to function for a while before ultimately dying. The rate of PSA level drop for successful radiation therapy is much slower than that of surgery. PSA usually drops by half every three to four months after radiation, and typically to the lowest level in about 12 to 18 months."
What is a risk factor?,"A risk factor is something that raises the chance of getting a disease. Each cancer has its own risk factors. Having risk factors does not mean that someone will get cancer. Even when a person with a risk factor is found to have cancer, there’s no way to prove that the risk factor caused the cancer."
Can injuries cause cancer?,"Falls, bruises, broken bones, or other such injuries do not cause cancer. Sometimes a person might visit a health care provider for an injury and cancer is found. But the injury did not cause the cancer; the cancer was already there."
Can I bring cancer on myself?,Your personality and emotions cannot cause cancer and will not affect the outcome of your cancer. Research shows that there is no connection between personality types or attitude and cancer occurrence or outcomes.
Can stress cause cancer?,"Researchers have done many studies to see if there’s a link between personality, attitude, stress, and cancer. It’s known that stress affects the immune system, but so do many other things. At this time, there is no clear evidence that a person's stress level affects their risk of getting cancer."
Does sugar feed cancer?,"Sugar intake has not been shown to increase the risk of getting cancer, having cancer spread, or having it get worse. Still, sugars and sugar-sweetened drinks add a lot of calories to the diet and can cause weight gain, which is linked to cancer."
Is cancer contagious?,"You can’t catch cancer from someone who has it. You won’t get cancer by being around or touching someone with cancer. When family and friends stay away, people with cancer may feel isolated and alone. They need your visits and support. To learn more, seeis cancer contagious?"
Is cancer inherited?,"Sometimes, certain types of cancer seem to run in some families. In some cases, this might be because family members share certain behaviors or exposures that increase cancer risk, such as such as smoking. Cancer risk might also be affected by other factors, like obesity, that tend to run in some families."
What social impacts can cancer have?,"Even today, families, friends, and co-workers will sometimes stay away from a loved one with cancer. This can make the person with cancer feel isolated and alone. But you cannot “catch” cancer from them. Don’t be afraid reach out to the person with cancer. They need your visits and support."
What types of cancer are there?,"There are many types of cancer. Cancer can develop anywhere in the body and is named for the part of the body where it started. For instance, breast cancer that starts in the breast is still called breast cancer even if it spreads (metastasizes) to other parts of the body. There are two main categories of cancer: hematologic (blood) cancersare cancers of the blood cells, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Solid tumor cancersare cancers of any of the other body organs or tissues. The most common solid tumors are breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers.

Some cancers grow and spread fast. Others grow more slowly. Some are more likely to spread to other parts of the body. Others tend to stay where they started. Some types of cancer are best treated with surgery; others respond better to drugs such as chemotherapy. Often 2 or more treatments are used to get the best results."

What is the difference between a benign and a malignant tumor?,"Benign tumorsusually grow slowly, don't grow into tissues around them, and don't grow into other parts of the body. They also don't often cause symptoms unless they grow large enough to push on other structures. If they need treatment, it is usually surgery although radiation and medications can also be used. Benign tumors are not cancer. Benign tumorsusually grow slowly, don't grow into tissues around them, and don't grow into other parts of the body. They also don't often cause symptoms unless they grow large enough to push on other structures. If they need treatment, it is usually surgery although radiation and medications can also be used. Benign tumors are not cancer. Malignant tumors(cancer) can grow quickly and uncontrollably. These tumors can grow and spread into areas close by. Cells from these tumors can break away, travel through blood or lymph system, and begin to grow in other parts of the body. When this happens it is called metastasis. Symptoms from malignant tumors usually vary depending on where the tumor is located. Malignant tumors are treated with surgery, radiation, and drugs such as chemotherapy.

What causes cancer?,"Cancer cells develop because of multiple changes in their genes. These changes can have many possiblecauses. Lifestyle habits, genes you get from your parents, and being exposed to cancer-causing agents in the environment can all play a role. Many times, there is no obvious cause.

Lifestyle habits, genes you get from your parents, and being exposed to cancer-causing agents in the environment can all play a role. Many times, there is no obvious cause."
What is the cancer stage?,"When a cancer is found, tests are done to see how big the cancer is and whether it has spread from where it started. This is called thecancer's stage. A lower stage (such as a stage 1 or 2) means that the cancer has not spread very much. A higher number (such as a stage 3 or 4) means it has spread more. Stage 4 is the highest stage. The stage of the cancer is very important in choosing the best treatment for a person. Ask your doctor about your cancer's stage and what it means for you."
How does cancer spread?,"Cancer can spread from where it started (the primary site) to other parts of the body. When cancer cells break away from a tumor, they can travel to other areas of the body through either the bloodstream or the lymph system. Most of these escaped cancer cells die or are killed before they can start growing somewhere else. But one or two might settle in a new area, begin to grow, and form new tumors. This spread of cancer to a new part of the body is calledmetastasis.

How does breast cancer start?,"Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, butmen can get breast cancer, too. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, butmen can get breast cancer, too. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. (to learn more about how cancers start and spread, seewhat is cancer?) cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.

Seenon-cancerous breast conditionsto learn more."
Where does breast cancer start?,"Breast cancers can start from different parts of the breast. The breast is an organ that sits on top of the upper ribs and chest muscles. There is a left and right breast, and each one has mainly glands, ducts, and fatty tissue. In women, the breast makes and delivers milk to feed newborns and infants. The amount of fatty tissue in the breast determines the size of each breast. The breast has different parts: lobules are the glands that make breast milk. Cancers that start here are called lobular cancers. Ducts are small canals that come out from the lobules and carry the milk to the nipple. This is the most common place for breast cancer to start. Cancers that start here are called ductal cancers. The nipple is the opening in the skin of the breast where the ducts come together and turn into larger ducts so the milk can leave the breast. The nipple is surrounded by slightly darker thicker skin called the areola. A less common type of breast cancer called Paget disease of the breast can start in the nipple. The fat and connective tissue (stroma) surround the ducts and lobules and help keep them in place. A less common type of breast cancer called phyllodes tumor can start in the stroma. Blood vessels and lymph vessels are also found in each breast. Angiosarcoma is a less common type of breast cancer that can start in the lining of these vessels."
How does breast cancer spread?,"Breast cancer can spread when the cancer cells get into the blood or lymph system and then are carried to other parts of the body. The lymph (or lymphatic) system is a part of your body's immune system. It is a network of lymph nodes (small, bean-sized glands), ducts or vessels, and organs that work together to collect and carry clear lymph fluid through the body tissues to the blood. The clear lymph fluid inside the lymph vessels contains tissue by-products and waste material, as well as immune system cells. The lymph vessels carry lymph fluid away from the breast. In the case of breast cancer, cancer cells can enter those lymph vessels and start to grow in lymph nodes.
 
 Most of the lymph vessels of the breast drain into lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes), lymph nodes inside the chest near the breastbone (internal mammary lymph nodes), and lymph nodes around the collar bone (supraclavicular [above the collar bone] and infraclavicular [below the collar bone] lymph nodes). If cancer cells have spread to your lymph nodes, there is a higher chance that the cells could have traveled through the lymph system and spread (metastasized) to other parts of your body. Still, not all women with cancer cells in their lymph nodes develop metastases, and some women with no cancer cells in their lymph nodes might develop metastases later."
What are the types of breast cancer?,"There are many different types of breast cancer. The type is determined by the specific kind of cells in the breast that are affected. Most breast cancers are carcinomas. The most common breast cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma, are adenocarcinomas, since the cancers start in the gland cells in the milk ducts or the lobules (milk-producing glands). Other kinds of cancers can grow in the breast, like angiosarcoma or sarcoma, but are not considered breast cancer since they start in different cells of the breast.
 
 Breast cancers are also classified by certain types of proteins or genes each cancer might make. After a biopsy is done, breast cancer cells are tested for proteins called estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and the HER2 gene or protein. The tumor cells are also closely looked at in the lab to find out what grade it is. The specific proteins found and the tumor grade can help decide the stage of the cancer and treatment options."
What are lifestyle-related risk factors associated with breast cancer?,"Lifestyle-related risk factors, such as what you eat and how much you exercise, can increase your chance of developing breast cancer, but it‚ not yet known exactly how some of these risk factors cause normal cells to become cancer."
Can hormone changes lead to breast cancer?,"Hormones also seem to play a role in many cases of breast cancer, but just how this happens is not fully understood."
Do gene mutations lead to breast cancer?,"We do know that normal breast cells can become cancerous because of changes or mutations in genes. But only about 1 in 10 breast cancers (10%) are linked with known abnormal genes that are passed on from parents (inherited). Many genes have not yet been discovered, so women with a family history of breast cancer might have inherited an abnormal gene that doesn't show on a genetic test. Most breast cancers (about 90%) develop from acquired (not inherited) gene changes that have not yet been identified."
How can gene changes can lead to breast cancer?,"Genes control how our cells function. They are made up of a chemical called DNA, which comes from both our parents. DNA affects more than just how we look; it also can influence our risk for developing certain diseases, including some kinds of cancer. Normal cells have genes called proto-oncogenes, which help control when the cells grow, divide to make new cells, or stay alive. If a proto-oncogene is mutated (changed) in a certain way, it becomes an oncogene. Cells that have these mutated oncogenes can become cancer. Normal cells also have genes called tumor suppressor genes, which help control how often normal cells divide in two, repair DNA mistakes, or cause cells to die at the right time. If a cell has a mutated tumor suppressor gene, then the cell can turn into cancer. Cancers can be caused by gene changes that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes. Changes in many different genes are usually needed to cause breast cancer."
What are Inherited gene changes in breast cancer?,"Some gene changes (mutations) are inherited or passed to you from your parents. This means the mutations are in all your cells when you are born. Certain inherited gene changes can greatly increase the risk for developing certain cancers and are linked to many of the cancers that run in some families. For instance, the BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are tumor suppressor genes. When one of these genes changes, it no longer suppresses abnormal cell growth, and cancer is more likely to develop. A change in one of these genes can be passed from a parent to a child.
 
 Women have already begun to benefit from advances in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer. Genetic testing can identify some women who have inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes, as well as other less common genes such as PALB2, ATM, or CHEK2. These women can then take steps to reduce their risk of breast cancer by increasing awareness of their breasts and following appropriate screening recommendations to help find cancer at an earlier, more treatable stage. Since these mutations are also often associated with other cancers (besides breast), women with these mutations might also consider early screening and preventive actions for other cancers.
 
 Mutations in tumor suppressor genes like the BRCA genes are considered high penetrance because they often lead to cancer. Although many women with high penetrance mutations develop cancer, most cases of cancer (including breast cancer) are not caused by this kind of mutation. More often, low-penetrance mutations or gene variations are a factor in cancer development. Each of these may have a small effect on cancer occurring in any one person, but the overall effect on the population can be large because the mutations are common, and people often have more than one at the same time. The genes involved can affect things like hormone levels, metabolism, or other factors that impact risk for breast cancer. These genes might also cause much of the risk of breast cancer that runs in families."
What are acquired  gene changes?,"Most gene mutations linked to breast cancer are acquired.This means the change takes place in breast cells during a person's life rather than having been inherited or born with them. Acquired DNA mutations take place over time and are only in the breast cancer cells. Most gene mutations linked to breast cancer are acquired.This means the change takes place in breast cells during a person's life rather than having been inherited or born with them. Acquired DNA mutations take place over time and are only in the breast cancer cells. These acquired mutations of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes may result from other factors, like radiation or cancer-causing chemicals. But some gene changes may just be random events that sometimes happen inside a cell, without having an outside cause.So far, the causes of most acquired mutations that could lead to breast cancer are still unknown. Most breast cancers have several acquired gene mutations."
How can I understand colon cancer?,"To understand colorectal cancer, it helps to know about the normal structure and function of the colon and rectum. The colon and rectum make up the large intestine (or large bowel), which is part of the digestive system, also called thegastrointestinal (gi) system(see illustration below). Most of the large intestine is made up of the colon, a muscular tube about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long. The parts of the colon are named by which way the food is traveling through them. The first section is called theascending colon. It starts with a pouch called the cecum, where undigested food comes in from the small intestine. It continues upward on the right side of the abdomen (belly). The second section is called thetransverse colon. It goes across the body from the right to the left side. The third section is called thedescending colonbecause it descends (travels down) on the left side. The fourth section is called thesigmoid colonbecause of its shape. The sigmoid colon joins the rectum, which then connects to the anus. The ascending and transverse sections together are called theproximal colon. The descending and sigmoid colon are called thedistal colon. What is cancer? cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer cells. Learn more here. Anatomy gallery: digestive system explore our 3d interactive tour of the digestive system."
How do the colon and rectum work?,"The colon absorbs water and salt from the remaining food matter after it goes through the small intestine (small bowel). The waste matter that‚ left after going through the colon goes into therectum, the final 6 inches (15cm) of the digestive system. It‚ stored there until it passes through theanus. Ring-shaped muscles (also calledsphincters) around the anus keep stool from coming out until they relax during a bowel movement."
How does colorectal cancer start?,"Polyps in the colon or rectum most colorectal cancers start as a growth on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. These growths are calledpolyps. Polyps are quite common, especially as you get older. Most polyps are benign, or noncancerous. Some types of polyps can change into cancer over time (usually over many years). The chance of a polyp turning into cancer depends on the type of polyp it is. There are different types of polyps. Adenomatous polyps (adenomas):these polyps sometimes change into cancer. Because of this, adenomas are called aprecancerous condition.the 3 types of adenomas are tubular, villous, and tubulovillous. Tubular adenomas are the most common type of adenomatous polyps. Villous adenomas are the least common type of adenomatous polyps, but are more likely to change into cancer. Hyperplastic polyps and inflammatory polyps:these polyps are more common, but in general they are not precancerous. Some people with large (more than 1cm) hyperplastic polyps might need colorectal cancer screening with colonoscopy more often. Sessile serrated polyps (ssp) and traditional serrated adenomas (tsa):these polyps are often treated like adenomas because they have a higher risk of changing into cancer. Other factors that can make a polyp more likely to contain cancer or increase someone‚ risk of developing colorectal cancer include: size: if a polyp larger than 1 cm number: if more than 3 polyps are found histology: ifdysplasiais seen in the polyp. Dysplasia means that the cells look abnormal, but they haven‚ yet become cancer. For more details on the types of polyps and conditions that can lead to colorectal cancer, seeyour colon or rectal pathology report: polyps."
How does colorectal cancer spread?,"If cancer forms in a polyp, it can grow into the wall of the colon or rectum over time. The wall of the colon and rectum is made up of many layers. Colorectal cancer starts in the innermost layer (the mucosa) and can grow outward through some or all of the other layers (see picture below). When cancer cells are in the wall, they can then grow into blood vessels or lymph vessels (tiny channels that carry away waste and fluid). From there, they can travel to nearby lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. The stage (extent of spread) of a colorectal cancer depends on how deeply it grows into the wall and if it has spread outside the colon or rectum. For more on staging, seecolorectal cancer stages."
What are the types of cancer in the colon and rectum?,"Most colorectal cancers areadenocarcinomas. These cancers start in cells that make mucus to lubricate the inside of the colon and rectum. When doctors talk about colorectal cancer, they‚äôre almost always talking about this type. Some subtypes of adenocarcinoma, such as signet ring and mucinous, may have a worse prognosis (outlook) than other subtypes of adenocarcinoma. Other, much less common types of tumors can also start in the colon and rectum. These include: carcinoid tumors.these start from special hormone-making cells in the intestine. Seegastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists)start from nerve cells in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. Some are benign (not cancer). These tumors are most commonly found in the stomach and small intestine. They are not commonly found in the colon or rectum. Seegastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist). Lymphomasare cancers of immune system cells. They mostly start inlymph nodes, but they can also start in the colon, rectum, or other organs. Information on lymphomas of the digestive system can be found innon-hodgkin lymphoma. Sarcomascan start in blood vessels, muscle layers, or other connective tissues in the wall of the colon and rectum. Sarcomas of the colon or rectum are rare."
How common is colorectal cancer?,"About 106,590 new cases of colon cancer (54,210 in men and 52,380 in women) about 46,220 new cases of rectal cancer (27,330 in men and 18,890 in women) the rate of people being diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer each year has dropped overall since the mid-1980s, mainly because more people aregetting screenedand changing theirlifestyle-related risk factors. From 2011 to 2019, incidence rates dropped by about 1% each year. But this downward trend is mostly in older adults. In people younger than 55 years of age, rates have been increasing by 1% to 2% a year since the mid-1990s."
What is the Lifetime risk of colorectal cancer?,"Overall, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women. However, each person‚ risk might be higher or lower than this, depending on theirrisk factors for colorectal cancer."
What are the Deaths from colorectal cancer?,"In the united states, colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the fourth leading cause in women, but it‚ the second most common cause of cancer deaths when numbers for men and women are combined. It‚ expected to cause about 53,010 deaths during 2024. The death rate from colorectal cancer has been dropping in older adults for several decades. There are a number of likely reasons for this. One is that colorectal polyps are now being found more often by screening and removed before they can develop into cancers. Screening also results in many colorectal cancers being found earlier, when they are likely to be easier to treat. In addition, treatments for colorectal cancer have improved over the last few decades. In people under 55, however, death rates have been increasing about 1% per year since the mid-2000s."
How common is lung cancer?,"Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women in the united states (not counting skin cancer). In men,prostate canceris more common, whilebreast canceris more common in women. The american cancer society‚ estimates for lung cancer in the us for 2024 are: about 234,580 new cases of lung cancer (116,310 in men and 118,270 in women) about 125,070 deaths from lung cancer (65,790 in men and 59,280 in women) lung cancer mainly occurs in older people. Most people diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older; a very small number of people diagnosed are younger than 45. The average age of people when diagnosed is about 70. Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death in the us, accounting for about 1 in 5 of all cancer deaths. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than ofcolon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. On a positive note, the number of new lung cancer cases continues to decrease, partly because more people arequitting smoking(or not starting). The number of deaths from lung cancer continues to drop as well, due to fewer people smoking and advances in early detection and treatment."
What is the lifetime chance of getting lung cancer?,"Overall, the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 16; for a woman, the risk is about 1 in 17. These numbers include both people who smoke and those who don‚ smoke. For people who smoke, the risk is much higher, while for those who don't, the risk is lower. List item: black men are about 12% more likely to develop lung cancer than white men. The rate is about 16% lower in black women than in white women. List item: black and white women have lower rates than men, but the gap is closing. The lung cancer rate has been dropping among men over the past few decades, but only for about the past decade in women. List item: despite their overall risk of lung cancer being higher, black men arelesslikely to develop sclc than white men. Statistics on survival in people with lung cancer vary depending on the type of lung cancer, the stage (extent) of the cancer when it is diagnosed, and other factors."
How does smoking lead to lung cancer?,"Smoking tobacco is by far the leading cause of lung cancer. About 80% of lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking, and many others are caused by exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking is clearly the strongest risk factor for lung cancer, but it often interacts with other factors. People who smoke and are exposed to other known risk factors, such asradonandasbestos, are at an even higher risk. Not everyone who smokes gets lung cancer, so other factors like genetics probably play a role as well."
What are the causes of cancer in people who dont smoke?,"Not all people who get lung cancer smoke. Many people with lung cancer formerly smoked, but many others never smoked at all. Lung cancer in people who don‚ smoke can be caused by exposure to radon,secondhand smoke, air pollution, or other factors. Workplace exposures to asbestos,diesel exhaust, or other chemicals can also cause lung cancers in some people who don‚ smoke. Some people with no known risk factors may develop lung cancer. This may be due to random events that don‚ have an outside cause, but it also may be due to factors that we don‚ yet know about. Lung cancers in people who don‚ smoke are often different from those that occur in people who do. They tend to develop in younger people and often have certain gene changes that are different from those in tumors found in people who smoke. In some cases, these gene changes can be used to guide treatment."
How could gene changes lead to lung cancer?,"Dna is the molecule in our cells that makes up our genes, which control how our cells function. Dna, which comes from both our parents, affects more than just how we look. It also can influence our risk for developing certain diseases, including some kinds of cancer. Some genes help control when cells grow, divide to make new cells, and die: list item: genes that help cells grow, divide, or stay alive are calledoncogenes. List item: genes that help control cell division or cause cells to die at the right time are called tumor suppressor genes. Cancers can be caused by dna changes that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes. Changes in many different genes are usually needed to cause lung cancer. There are primarily two types of gene mutations (changes): germline mutations and somatic mutations."
What are Inherited gene changes (germline mutations)?,"Inherited gene changes, or germline mutations, are gene changes that you inherit from your parents. These are the mutations in your DNA that you inherit from the egg and sperm cells when you are conceived. Some people inherit DNA mutations from their parents that may increase their risk for developing certain cancers. Historically, germline mutations were not thought to cause very many lung cancers. However, recent studies have shown there may be a benefit to test all patients with lung cancer for germline mutations. If germline mutations are found, it would not only show that you were at an increased hereditary risk for developing lung cancer, but it could also help guide discussions about the best way to treat your lung cancer. If you have lung cancer and are also found to have a certain germline mutation, you may respond well to targeted therapy. Examples of possible germline mutations for patients with lung cancer include: CHEK2, ATM, TP53, BRCA1, EGFR, APC, and PALB2. Studies are ongoing to better understand the role of germline mutations in lung cancer. Regardless of whether you carry a higher hereditary risk for lung cancer, doctors recommend that all people avoid tobacco smoke and other exposures that will increase cancer risk. Acquired gene changes (somatic mutations or driver mutations) may occur in any individual cell and cannot be inherited. Somatic mutations refer to DNA changes within cells that were not passed from your parents, but rather were acquired during your lifetime. Certain somatic mutations can affect the cell’s ability to control its own growth and will eventually transform a non-cancer cell into a cancer cell. These somatic mutations are also known as driver mutations. If your tumor is found to have a driver mutation, you will likely respond well to targeted therapy. For patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, it is recommended that the lung mass or a metastatic mass be tested for driver mutations. It is standard practice to test for the following driver mutations: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, MET, RET, BRAF, and NTRK. If any of these driver mutations are found, initial treatment with targeted therapy (rather than chemotherapy) would be recommended. Although these mutations can be found in any patient with lung cancer, non-smokers with lung cancer are more likely to have a driver mutation."
What is anal cancer?,"Anal cancer is a cancer that begins in the anus, the opening at the end of the gastrointestinal tract through which stool, or solid waste, leaves the body. The anus begins at the bottom of the rectum, which is the last part of the large intestine (also called the colon).
 Anal cancer usually affects adults over age 60 and women more often than men."
What are the treatment options for anal cancer?,"There are three types of standard treatment for anal cancer:
 
 Radiation therapy—a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. The type of radiation therapy used to treat anal cancer is:
 external beam therapy, in which high-energy x-ray beams generated by a machine are directed at the tumor from outside the body (usually by a linear accelerator) and targeted at the tumor site. These x-rays can destroy the cancer cells and careful treatment planning allows the surrounding normal tissues to be spared. No radioactive sources are placed inside the patient's body.
 Chemotherapy—a cancer treatment that uses chemical substances or drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from dividing.
 Surgery—surgical treatments for anal cancer include:
 local resection, in which a small tumor in the lower part of the anus and some of the healthy tissue surrounding it are surgically removed.
 abdominoperineal resection, in which cancer cells in the anus, rectum and part of the large intestine are removed through an incision made in the abdomen. Lymph nodes that contain cancer may also be removed."
What happens during radiation therapy for anal cancer,"Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles. When radiation is used at high doses—much higher than the amount used to obtain x-ray images—it can destroy abnormal cells that cause cancer. It does this by damaging the cell's DNA, which eventually causes the cell to die.
 Because of the importance of treating the cancer but sparing healthy tissue, you will visit the medical center before actual therapy for treatment planning and simulation. Correct patient positions for radiation exposure are determined for accurate, effective therapeutic results. Your skin may be marked with permanent ink. Custom-made lead shields may be constructed to protect your healthy organs from the radiation, or the radiation fields may be shaped for your situation with special blocks inside the radiation machine. CT or MRI scans may be used to better represent the tumor and the sensitive normal tissues for treatment planning.
 External beam therapy (EBT) with high energy x-rays is often delivered from a machine called a linear accelerator. Patients undergo EBT during a series of outpatient treatments over several weeks. The patient's diagnosis determines the total duration of treatment. Each treatment session lasts less than an hour, most of which is spent positioning the patient."
What are possible side effects of anal cancer radiation therapy?,"Side effects of radiation treatment include problems that occur as a result of the treatment itself as well as from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area.
 The number and severity of side effects you may experience will depend on the type of radiation and dosage you receive and the part of your body being treated. You should talk to your doctor and nurse about any side effects you experience so they can help you manage them.
 Radiation therapy can cause early and late side effects. Early side effects occur during or immediately after treatment and are typically gone within a few weeks. Common early side effects of radiation therapy include tiredness or fatigue and skin problems. Skin in the treatment area may become more sensitive, red, irritated, or swollen. Other skin changes include dryness, itching, peeling and blistering.
 Depending on the area being treated, other early side effects may include:
 
 temporary anal irritation and pain
 discomfort during bowel movements
 fatigue
 diarrhea
 nausea and vomiting
 in women, irritation to the vagina, including discomfort and drainage.
 
 Late side effects, which are rare, occur months or years following treatment and are often permanent. They include:
 
 damage to anal tissue and the formation of scar tissue
 changes to the anal sphincter
 risk of fractures in the pelvis or hip
 damage to the blood vessels in the lining of the rectum, causing inflammation, rectal bleeding and pain
 infertility
 vaginal dryness and the formation of scar tissue in the vagina
 abnormal swelling in the legs, called lymphedema.
 
 There is a slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. Following radiation treatment for cancer, you should be checked on a regular basis by your radiation oncologist for recurring and new cancers."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect after anal cancer therapy?,"After your treatment has ended, your physician will want to watch you closely for a recurrence of cancer and to monitor your treatment-related side effects. Follow-up appointments, which may be scheduled every three months for two years, may include:
 
 a physical examination, including a rectal exam, and questions about any problems or symptoms you are experiencing 
 blood tests
 imaging tests, such as x-rays or a computed tomography (CT) scan"
Are there any new developments in treating my disease?,"New treatments for anal cancer are being studied, including:
 
 radiosensitizing agents, chemotherapy and other drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation therapy, thus increasing its effect. The use of radiosensitizing agents may allow patients to receive lower doses of radiation and chemotherapy or lessen treatment side effects
 combinations of external beam radiation and brachytherapy
 the addition of monoclonal antibody therapy to chemotherapy
 the use of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines to help the body's immune system attack pre-cancers and HPV-cancers
 
 Additional research is focused on learning how HPV, a major factor in the development of anal cancer, causes anal cells to become cancerous. Scientists are also studying the value of screening tests for anal cancer, especially in people who are at risk for the disease.
 Clinical Trials

 Clinical Trials - from the National Cancer Institute's Web site:"
What is lung cancer?,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Many lung cancers are preventable. Inhaling cancer-causing substances such as tobacco smoke may lead to lung tissue changes shortly after exposure — so-called precancerous changes. Nevertheless, cancer typically develops over a period of many years. If detected early enough, it can often be successfully treated."
What are the pre-treatment evaluations for lung cancer?,"Before treatment, the doctor will usually perform a biopsy to determine whether cancer is present and, if so, what type.
 Doctors use medical imaging to determine the stage of the tumor. Treatment options (and their expected results) depend on the stage of the tumor. The imaging usually includes chest X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT). It may also include a PET/CT scan and MRI of the brain. 
 You may undergo pulmonary and cardiac functional tests to determine if you can tolerate surgery.
 Blood tests will determine if you can tolerate chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy."
What are the treatment options for lung cancer?,"Treatment options overview
 Tumor genomic testing is now standard of care for many lung tumors. These tests help your doctor select the most appropriate treatment for your condition. Your doctor may treat early-stage lung cancer with standard treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy. 
 
 Surgery is the primary treatment for patients with early-stage cancer who are in good general health. The goal of surgery is to totally remove all the tumor cells and thereby provide a cure. Unfortunately, lung cancers tend to develop in smokers over age 50 who often have other serious conditions that increase the risk of surgery.
 
 Radiation therapy (radiotherapy) uses high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells and to ease symptoms. Doctors use it:
  
 As primary treatment
 Before surgery to shrink the tumor
 After surgery to eliminate any cancer cells that remain in the treated area
 To treat lung cancer that has spread to the brain or other areas of the body or to ease symptoms
 
  Besides attacking the tumor, radiotherapy can help relieve symptoms such as bleeding, cough, and pain. When used as an initial treatment instead of surgery, radiotherapy may be given alone or combined with chemotherapy. Patients who have a small, localized lung cancer, but are not candidates for surgery, may receive stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Patients who are poor candidates for surgery include the elderly, patients with chronic heart failure, and patients on blood thinning drugs that put them at risk of surgical bleeding. SBRT uses small, focused radiation beams that track the lung tumor along with its respiratory movement. It typically uses three to five treatments to deliver very high doses of radiation to patients with localized, early-stage lung cancer who cannot have surgery. See the SRS and SBRT page for more information.
  Most often, radiation therapy uses the external beam technique, which aims a beam of x-rays or protons directly at the tumor. Treatment is given in a series of sessions over six to seven weeks. For more detailed information, see the External Beam Therapy (EBT) page. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) use a 3-D image of the tumor taken with CT scanning. This image serves as the target for a high-dose radiation beam that can change in shape and size to match the tumor. This method minimizes radiation exposure of nearby normal lung tissue. See the Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) page for more information.
 Proton therapy uses protons instead of x-rays. Protons can pass through healthy tissue without damaging it. 
 Doctors use systemic therapies to treat cancer that has already or is likely to spread throughout the body. Radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy treats disease that has already spread to the lymph nodes. Occasionally, surgery may be done before chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Doctors typically treat late-stage disease that has already spread to other parts of the body with systemic treatments such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy. They may also use radiation therapy to consolidate any residual disease after systemic treatment and to relieve symptoms. Selection of the best treatment is frequently based on specific genetic tests done on tumor cells removed during a biopsy.
 
 
 Chemotherapy uses drugs that kill cancer cells. Patients usually receive chemotherapy by direct injection into a vein or through a catheter placed in a large vein. Doctors often give chemotherapy after surgery to eliminate microscopic disease. Chemotherapy also may slow tumor growth and relieve symptoms in patients who cannot have surgery. Doctors are investigating newer biologic agents, which may have fewer side effects than chemotherapy and be just as effective. Chemotherapy treats all stages of lung cancer. It can prolong life even in elderly persons if they are in good general health. Some chemotherapy drugs increase the effectiveness of radiation treatment. Others keep the tumor cells at a stage where radiation treatment is more effective. Or they impair the cancer cells’ ability to repair themselves after radiation therapy. There is growing evidence that a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is more effective than radiotherapy alone. However, there is a substantial risk of serious side effects. 
 Chemotherapy may cause significant side effects. These include nausea with vomiting and damage to the white blood cells that fight infection. However, there are ways to counter and treat most of these side effects.
 
 Targeted therapy uses man-made molecules called monoclonal antibodies. Natural antibodies attack invading foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. Monoclonal antibodies act like natural antibodies by recognizing and binding to the surface of cancer cells. Your doctor may combine them with a chemotherapy drug or radioactive material. This allows the antibody to deliver the cancer-killing agent directly to the cancer cell. 
 Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This type of therapy depends on the identification of markers on the surface of tumor cells."
How does the stage of disease guide lung cancer treatment?,"Small-cell lung cancer:
 
 Doctors use chemotherapy and radiation therapy to treat limited stage disease (confined to the chest). Radiation typically starts concurrently with the first or second dose of chemotherapy. Six weeks of once-daily radiation or three weeks of twice-daily radiation are common radiation regimens.
 The radiation oncologist may suggest radiation therapy directed at the brain for limited stage disease even though no cancer has been found there.
 Doctors usually use chemotherapy alone to treat extensive stage SCLC.
 The radiation oncologist may consider radiation therapy directed at the brain for extensive stage disease even though no cancer has been found there. There is less strong evidence for prophylactic brain radiation than in limited stage disease.
 The treatment team may also consider consolidation radiation to the bulky areas of the original tumor in the chest.
 Radiotherapy or chemotherapy may help to reduce pain or other symptoms for disease recurrence or disease that persists after initial treatment. Radiotherapy or laser treatment can keep the airways open, allowing the patient to breathe more freely.
 
 Non-small-cell lung cancer:
 
 Early Stage: The earliest NSCLCs are very small tumors. Special tests may be needed to locate the main tumor. Doctors treat early-stage tumors with surgery or stereotactic radiation therapy.
 Advanced Stage: Doctors use combined treatment when cancer has spread to structures near the lung, such as the chest wall, diaphragm , or lymph nodes in the chest. Depending on the exact location of cancer, patients may receive radiation therapy alone or combined with surgery and/or chemotherapy.
 Tumor that has spread to other parts of the body: Doctors use chemotherapy and targeted therapy for patients whose tumors have spread beyond the chest or into the opposite lung. Surgery does not generally benefit people whose cancer has spread beyond the chest. Chemotherapy prolongs life, and radiation therapy can help relieve symptoms caused by tumor. Sometimes, the doctor may recommend brain surgery for patients whose NSCLC has spread to the brain.
 Any lung cancer patient should consider taking part in a clinical trial to help find more effective treatments for lung cancer."
How does the treatment method depend on the type of lung cancer?,"There are two main types of lung cancer that have different microscopic appearances:
 
 Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is usually found in active or former cigarette smokers. Although SCLC is less common than non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), it is an aggressive tumor that is more likely to spread to other body sites. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment for SCLC. Your doctor may use radiation therapy with chemotherapy to treat lung tumors that have not spread beyond the chest or other organs. Because SCLC tends to spread quickly, surgery is not a common treatment. However, your doctor may use surgery to obtain tissue samples for lab analysis to determine the type of lung cancer present. SCLC patients may receive additional radiation therapy directed at the brain. This helps prevent cancer from spreading from the lungs to the brain.
 Non-small-cell lung cancer tends to grow slowly and takes longer to spread beyond the lung. Patients usually receive surgery and/or radiation therapy. Your treatment may also use chemotherapy to increase the effectiveness of surgery or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy in NSCLC is generally different than in SCLC. Also, different types of NSCLC may require different types of chemotherapy."
How effective is treatment for inoperable lung cancer?,"It is extremely important to remember that “inoperable” does not mean “incurable” when it comes to lung cancer. In fact, an increasing number of patients are being treated with a non-surgical approach across all stages of this disease. Treatment effectiveness depends on the stage of disease. In early stage inoperable disease that is treated with radiotherapy alone, control of the local disease is typical. In more advanced disease, a combination of chemotherapy and radiation is delivered with curative intent. Cure rates are lower but still possible with disease spread to the lymph nodes within the chest. The medical or radiation oncologist may propose a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for a patient who is otherwise well.
 
 When cure is not a possibility, doctors recommend palliative treatment. This is the use of medications, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other measures to relieve symptoms of lung cancer without eliminating the tumor. The doctor will use smaller doses of radiation therapy to avoid side effects. At some point, if you and your oncologist or primary care physician agree that active treatment is no longer advisable, hospice care can provide comfort and support.
 
 Pain relief is a very important part of treating lung cancer. Although many effective treatments are available, and there are devices for delivering medication on demand without overdosing, many cancer patients still do not receive adequate pain relief. When the needs of the patient are clearly expressed, doctors can better provide appropriate care."
What happens during radiation therapy for lung cancer?,"Radiation therapy delivers focused high-energy x-rays (photons), gamma rays, or atomic particles. It affects cells that are rapidly dividing—such as cancer cells—much more than those that are not. Most cancers, including lung tumors, are made of cells that divide more rapidly than those in normal lung tissue. This means the tumor may be eliminated without damaging surrounding normal tissues. Radiotherapy acts by attacking the DNA within tumor cells, making it impossible for them to grow and create more cancer cells. Normal body cells may also be damaged, but they are able to repair themselves and function properly once again. The key is to give daily doses of radiation large enough to kill a high percentage of the rapidly dividing cancer cells, while minimizing damage to the more slowly dividing normal tissue cells in the same area."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for lung cancer?,"Overall, radiotherapy is a local treatment. Any side effects usually happen in the parts of the body where radiation passes through. Radiotherapy usually does not damage normal organs outside the path of the treatment beam.
 Most patients tire easily during their course of radiation treatment. This fatigue occurs two to three weeks after treatment starts and gradually increases as treatment continues. It may become severe and seriously limit your ability to engage in normal daily activities. Typically, fatigue lessens one to two months after radiotherapy is completed. If you experience fatigue, it is important to get enough rest. However, at the same time, your doctor may suggest that you stay as active as possible.
 Some patients experience hair loss on the chest included in the radiation field. Depending on how much radiation is delivered, this may be temporary or permanent.
 Skin irritation is common after a few weeks of radiation therapy. The affected area may be red, dry, tender, and itchy. This reaction can become quite severe during a long course of treatment. It helps to keep the skin clean with gentle soap and warm water, to dry it well, and to avoid very hot water while bathing. Sunscreen should be used when skin in the treated area is exposed to sunlight. Do not use perfumes, cosmetics, or deodorants in the treatment area. After daily treatments, you may apply an unscented cream or lotion.
 Temporary loss of appetite is a possibility.
 Esophagitis or inflammation of the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) is common if radiotherapy is directed at the lymph nodes in the central chest or if the tumor is near the esophagus. This condition can be severe. The esophagus is very sensitive to radiation, and the symptoms are worse in patients who also receive chemotherapy. Esophagitis can make it difficult to swallow, and some patients need intravenous (IV) pain medication or fluids to get through the full course of radiation treatment. Some people experience esophagitis as the sensation of a lump or discomfort before it becomes overtly painful. Some foods (such as spicy or acidic foods or bread) feel worse than others. It is important to remember that although certain foods may cause pain with swallowing, they will not cause damage. Avoid foods that cause pain until about one month after the final day of radiation. The inflammation generally plateaus toward the end of treatment and starts to resolve within two to three weeks after treatment in most patients. 
 An inflammation of the lungs called radiation pneumonitis may develop three to six months after radiotherapy is over. It causes coughing and shortness of breath as well as fever. In most cases, it calls for no specific treatment and gets better within two to four weeks. It can occasionally happen earlier and require steroids and/or oxygen.
 Decrease in a specific type of white blood cell called lymphocytes is another side effect of radiotherapy."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect after lung therapy?,"Once radiotherapy ends, your doctor will want to see you after four to six weeks and then every three to six months for the first two years. After this, you may see the doctor every six months for three years and then once a year. Your medical or radiation oncologist will often prescribe a computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This will take place about four to eight weeks after treatment ends, when the response is expected to be the greatest. These images will help to assess response and make it possible to do comparisons with earlier images. It also allows your doctor to find treatment-related complications at an early stage. Imaging can tell the difference between recurrent cancer and lung scars produced by high-dose radiation treatment. By obtaining chest imaging on a regular basis, (generally no more than two to four times per year), recurrent cancers may be discovered in time to be successfully re-treated.
 In addition to x-rays, other tests such as blood cell counts and bronchoscopy may be a routine part of the follow-up exam. Your doctor may use other tests to follow up on symptoms or findings on chest imaging. If new symptoms develop in another part of the body, your doctor may test to detect any potential problem. 
 After treatment, the tumor may be gone (cured). Or it can regrow in an area of the original tumor (recur) or remain after treatment (residual tumor). Patients who have had one cancer may develop a second, unrelated primary lung cancer. This happens to about 3 percent of patients per year."
Are there any new developments in treating lung cancer?,"Less invasive surgical methods are under study. They require a much smaller incision and allow the patient to be up within hours after surgery ends. 
 Angiogenesis inhibitors are agents that prevent new blood vessels from forming in growing cancers and may shut off the tumor’s blood supply. This remains an experimental approach but it is promising in part because it seems to cause very few side effects.

What is brachytherapy and how is it used?,"Brachytherapy, also called internal radiation therapy, places radioactive material directly inside or next to the tumor. It uses a higher total dose of radiation to treat a smaller area than external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) which directs high-energy x-ray beams at a tumor from outside the body.
 Brachytherapy treats cancers throughout the body, including the:
 
 prostate - see the Prostate Cancer Treatment page
 cervix - see the Cervical Cancer Treatment page
 head and neck - see the Head and Neck Cancer Treatment page
 skin
 breast - see the Breast Cancer Treatment page
 gallbladder
 uterus
 vagina
 lung - see the Lung Cancer Treatment page
 rectum
 eye
 
 
 Brachytherapy is seldom used in children. However, brachytherapy has the advantage of using a highly localized dose of radiation. This means that less radiation is delivered to surrounding tissue. This significantly decreases the risk of radiation-induced second malignancies, a serious concern in children. The treatment is most often used for rare pediatric cancers (rhabdomyosarcoma). About 250 children are diagnosed with these rare cancers each year in the U.S.
 
 Brachytherapy may be temporary or permanent. Talk to your radiation oncologist about the specifics of your treatment.
 Temporary brachytherapy places radioactive material inside a catheter for a specific amount of time and then removes it. It is given at a low-dose rate (LDR), meaning a lower intensity over a longer period of time, or high-dose rate (HDR), meaning a higher intensity over a shorter period of time.
 Permanent brachytherapy is also called seed implantation. It puts radioactive seeds (about the size of a grain of rice) in or near the tumor permanently. After several months, the seeds lose their radioactivity. Sometimes, active seeds may trigger radiation detectors at security checkpoints. You may need a doctor's note to explain your situation to security personnel. Inactive seeds are harmless and rarely trigger metal detectors."
Who will be involved in brachytherapy?,"Brachytherapy requires a treatment team. This team includes a radiation oncologist, medical physicist, dosimetrist, radiation therapist, nurse and, sometimes, a surgeon and/or anesthesiologist. The radiation oncologist is a highly trained doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiotherapy. The radiation oncologist evaluates the patient, identifies the treatment and determines the appropriate therapy and radiation dose. In some cases, a surgeon will assist by placing treatment devices in the patient, and an anesthesiologist may assist in ensuring the patient is comfortable. The medical physicist, dosimetrist and radiation oncologist determine how to deliver the radiation and how much the patient can tolerate. The physicist and the dosimetrist then make detailed treatment calculations. The radiation therapist, a specially trained technologist, may help deliver treatment. The nurse provides information about the possible side effects. The nurse also helps manage care for treatment catheters. The radiation oncologist obtains consent from the patient and provides details about the treatment, its benefits and its potential toxicities."
What equipments are used in brachytherapy?,"The type of radioactive material used (iodine, palladium, cesium or iridium) depends on the type of treatment. In all types, the radiation source is encapsulated. This means it is enclosed within a non-radioactive metallic capsule often referred to as a ""seed."" This helps prevent the material from moving to other parts of the patient's body.
 Permanent implants put radioactive seeds directly in the tumor using a special delivery device. This is usually done with ultrasound and/or x-ray imaging to ensure accurate placement.
 Temporary implants use needles, catheters or special applicators. After the device's accurate position is confirmed, the radiation sources are inserted. This is called ""afterloading."" The radiation oncologist may insert and remove the material by hand after placing the delivery device. Or, the oncologist may use a computer-controlled remote afterloading machine to insert the material. Medical imaging helps position the material to treat the tumor in the most effective way. A computer calculates the source position and the amount of time needed to deliver the desired radiation dose."
Who operates the brachytherapy equipments?,"The radiation oncologist creates the overall treatment plan. A medical physicist and a radiation oncologist confirm and approve the treatment before delivery. Setup is verified by the radiation therapist, the medical physicist, and the radiation oncologist. A radiation therapist operates the equipment."
What preparations are required before a brachytherapy procedure?,"Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for treatment. These preparations may include:
 
 Bowel preparation
 Pre-treatment ultrasound, MRI or CT scan
 Blood tests
 Electrocardiogram (EKG)
 Chest X-rays
 
 Your doctor may also use a computer to plan the treatment before the actual procedure."
How is the brachytherapy procedure performed?,"Permanent brachytherapy:
 Permanent brachytherapy inserts needles pre-filled with radioactive seeds into the tumor. The doctor will remove the needle and leave the seeds behind. Seeds may also be implanted using a device that inserts them individually at regular intervals. The procedure may use medical imaging to help position the seeds. The doctor may do more imaging tests later to verify seed placement.
 Temporary brachytherapy:
 Temporary brachytherapy places a delivery device, such as a catheter, needle, or applicator into or near the tumor. Medical imaging helps position the radiation sources. The doctor may insert the delivery device into a body cavity, such as the vagina or uterus (intracavitary). Or, the doctor may insert an applicator (needle or catheter) into body tissues (interstitial). The doctor may place an applicator on the surface of the skin to treat skin malignancies. 
 High dose-rate (HDR) treatments deliver radiation over 10 to 20 minutes per session. Low dose-rate (LDR) treatments deliver radiation over 20 to 50 hours. Pulsed dose-rate (PDR) treatments deliver radiation in periodic pulses.
 HDR treatment is usually an outpatient procedure. However, some patients are admitted to the hospital for one to two days to have several HDR treatments using the same applicator. HDR treatment delivers a specified dose of radiation to the tumor in a short burst using a remote afterloading machine. The machine stores a powerful source of radioactive isotopes (Iridium-192) and protects personnel from unnecessary radiation exposure. The HDR treatment lasts about 10 to 20 minutes. The entire procedure (including placement of the delivery device) may take up to several hours. This may be repeated a couple times in a day before the delivery device is removed. Patients may receive up to 10 separate HDR treatments over one or more weeks.
 LDR treatment delivers radiation at a continuous rate over one to two days. It requires an overnight stay at the hospital. This allows the delivery device to remain in place throughout the treatment period. PDR treatment delivers radiation similarly using periodic pulses (usually one per hour). The doctor may insert the material through the delivery device by hand and remove it later once treatment is complete.
 Once treatment is complete, the doctor removes the delivery device from the patient."
What will patient feel during brachytherapy procedure?,"Before treatment begins, the doctor may place an intravenous (IV) line into your arm or hand to deliver medication. Depending on the site of the tumor and your doctor's recommendations, you may receive general anesthesia and/or a sedative to make you feel sleepy. If anesthesia or heavy sedation is used, you will be moved to a recovery room afterwards. Depending on the type of treatment, you may return home the same day or be moved to a hospital room.
 Patients who have an afterloaded implant for temporary brachytherapy may hear a clicking or humming noise from the treatment machine. This occurs as the machine pushes the radioactive material into the treatment device previously placed at the tumor site. You will be alone during the procedure. However, you will be able to speak with your treatment team via a microphone. The team will be located nearby, where they can see and hear you. PDR treatment will allow you to have visitors between the treatment pulses. LDR treatment will require you to stay in the hospital. Visits are usually limited to about 30 minutes per visitor per day. Children and pregnant women may not visit. No radiation remains in your body after temporary brachytherapy, so there is no risk to others.
 Some LDR, PDR and HDR treatments require one or more days in the hospital and may cause discomfort. This may be due to the catheters or applicators and having to stay relatively still for a prolonged period. Your doctor will prescribe medication to relieve your pain. Most HDR treatments are delivered in the outpatient setting and are non-invasive.
 After permanent brachytherapy, the implanted seeds' radioactivity decays with time, depending on which radioactive isotope is used. Ask your doctor if you should limit close contact with others, such as pregnant women or children. With temporary implants, the doctor removes all radioactive material before you return home. There is no risk of exposure after the doctor removes the delivery device and radiation sources.
 Your doctor and/or treatment team will give you specific home-care instructions. It is uncommon to have tenderness and swelling in the treatment area or other symptoms. This will depend on your specific treatment. Most patients are able to resume normal activities within days or weeks. However, you may have a small risk of long-term side effects. Talk to your treatment team about how to manage them.
 Your doctor may recommend a series of follow-up exams after treatment. These may include a physical check-up, imaging exam(s), and blood or other lab tests.
 These visits help your doctor see if your condition is stable or has changed. They also allow you to discuss any treatment side effects with your doctor."
What is Lymphoma,"Lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the white blood cells (lymphocytes) of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of your body's immune system.
 There are two major types of lymphoma: Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin (NHL). Both have several subtypes. HL is far less common than NHL. Individual lymphomas behave, spread, and respond to treatment differently from one another."
What are the available treatments for lymphoma?,"Treatment depends on the type and stage of your lymphoma. It also depends on your age, overall health, medical history, and tolerance for specific therapies. Sometimes, the disease is advanced but slow growing with no symptoms. If so, your doctor may take a ""wait-and-see"" approach.
 Standard options include:
 
 Chemotherapy is a primary treatment for lymphoma. You may receive it by vein (IV) or in pill form. Your doctor may use it alone or with radiation therapy. Chemotherapy may decrease the chance lymphoma will return in other areas of the body. Like radiation therapy, it can ease symptoms and extend life for patients with tumors that have spread. Your doctor will usually give chemotherapy over time with periods of no treatment. This lowers possible side effects, such as abnormal blood-cell counts, fatigue, diarrhea, mouth sores, and risk of infection.
  
 Central nervous system prophylaxis injects chemotherapy into the spinal column through a lumbar puncture. Your doctor may use it to treat certain types of NHL that have spread to the brain or are at high risk for such spread. Also, your doctor may prescribe steroids to relieve swelling and inflammation.
  
 
 
 Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to shrink tumors and kill cancer cells. Your doctor may use it alone or with chemotherapy.
  
 External beam therapy (EBT) targets a beam of high-energy x-rays directly to the tumor. These x-rays can destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. EBT does not place radioactive sources inside your body.
  
 
 
 Monoclonal antibody therapy (targeted therapy) uses man-made molecules called monoclonal antibodies. Natural antibodies attack invading foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. Monoclonal antibodies act like natural antibodies by recognizing and binding to the surface of cancer cells. Your doctor may combine them with a chemotherapy drug or radioactive material. This allows the antibody to deliver the cancer-killing agent directly to the cancer cell. There are two monoclonal antibodies for lymphoma treatment:
  
 Rituximab seeks out and locks onto the protein receptor (CD20) found on a specific type of lymphocyte (B cells). This causes the lymphoma cell to die. This treatment is for patients with ""B-cell"" lymphoma. You may receive it with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
 Tafasitamab-cxix attaches to protein receptor CD19.
 Brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris®) combines a chemotherapy drug with a monoclonal antibody that attaches to a specific molecule (CD30) on the surface of HL disease cells. Polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy®) attaches to protein receptor CD79b. 
 
 
 Radioimmunotherapy (radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy) pairs a monoclonal antibody with a radioactive material. The radiolabeled monoclonal antibody travels and binds to cancer cells. This delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor.
 Biologic therapy uses natural or man-made substances to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. Interferon is one type of biologic therapy. It affects cancer cell division and can slow tumor growth. Other therapies interfere with metabolic pathways within the cancer cells to slow growth.
 Stem cell transplant (SCT) helps grow new bone marrow by replacing diseased bone marrow with the patient's (or a donor's) healthy stem cells. SCT may be an option if lymphoma returns after treatment. Before SCT, patients may receive whole-body EBT and high-dose chemotherapy to rid the body of as many lymphoma cells as possible.
 Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy uses the patient’s own T cells. T cells are removed from the bloodstream and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is added in a lab. The “educated” CAR T-cells are injected back into the patient to find and kill the lymphoma cells."
How to choose different treatments for lymphoma,"Your doctors will provide you with information specific to your care. They will recommend appropriate treatment(s) and discuss them with you. Your cancer specialist will analyze the data and assess your condition before recommending your best treatment option. Occasionally, different options may be equally effective. However, each may come with different potential risks or side effects.
 If you receive radiation, a radiation oncologist will determine how many treatments to give and where."
How effective is modern radiation treatment of lymphoma?,"Radiation is extremely effective in treating lymphoma. This is because most lymphomas are quite radiosensitive. Meaning, they respond well to moderate doses of radiation. For early stage, intermediate, and high-grade lymphoma, patients receive chemotherapy and then radiation to the initial area(s) of concern. In advanced disease, your doctor may add radiation to previously bulky sites or sites that are not responding well to treatment. Your doctor may also use radiation in very low doses to control local symptoms in any stage. For some unusual types of low-grade lymphoma that present with limited disease, radiation therapy alone may be curative."
What happens during radiation therapy for lymphoma?,"Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays. High doses of radiation—much higher than x-ray imaging—can destroy abnormal cells that cause cancer. Radiation damages cancer cells' DNA and eventually causes them to die.
 It is important to spare healthy tissue while treating cancer. Radiation planning and design relies on imaging the area to be treated. At the time of ""simulation,"" you will meet a Radiation Therapy Technologist (RTT). The RTT will work with your doctor to determine the correct body position for the best results from the radiation. Once your treatment position is set, you will have a CT scan. The RTT may mark your skin with semi-permanent ink or tiny dot tattoos. Treatment planning may use CT, PET or MRI scans to better localize the tumor and the surrounding healthy tissue. After the simulation, the radiation oncologist will work with other team members (dosimetrist and medical physicist) to design and calculate the best plan for radiation.
 Involved field or involved site radiation therapy delivers radiation only to the areas where lymphoma is present. This is the most common type of radiation therapy for lymphoma. You may receive it with chemotherapy. Total nodal irradiation delivers radiation to all the lymph nodes in the body. This immunosuppressive therapy helps facilitate stem cell or organ transplantation. Total body irradiation delivers radiation to the entire body. Stem cell transplant (SCT) patients receive it prior to chemotherapy and transplant. Radiation may relieve symptoms caused by lymphoma that spreads to the brain or spinal cord, puts pressure on nerves, or obstructs organ function."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for lymphoma?,"While side effects vary from person to person, some are typical.
 Radiation treatments usually have no immediate side effects. Most patients have mild fatigue that builds up gradually over the course of therapy. This slowly goes away one to two months after radiation therapy. Some patients have some reddening, dryness, and itchy skin after a few weeks. Skin reactions usually heal completely within a few weeks of completing treatment.
 If you have radiation to the abdomen or pelvis, diarrhea, frequent bowel movements or appetite loss may occur. Medication can ease these side effects. Generally, side effects gradually stop once treatment is complete."
What kind of treatment follow-up for lymphoma?,"Lymphoma can reappear (recur) in previously treated patients. Because patients can sometimes be cured after their tumor recurs, follow-up care is critically important.
 
 Physical exam: You will have physical exams from a few weeks to many years after treatment, especially if side effects do not ease, or new symptoms develop.
 Blood tests: Your doctor will test your blood periodically to check general organ function and for a lymphoma recurrence.
 Imaging: During follow-up exams, you may have x-ray, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These images will help assess your response to therapy. They will also look for signs of side effects and whether your cancer is back."
What are the latest advancements in lymphoma treatment?,"Contemporary therapy often cures lymphoma patients. Your doctor will advise you on how to maintain optimal health. Meanwhile, researchers are exploring the least complicated cures for newly diagnosed patients. They are also gaining a better understanding of lymphoma, including its risk factors and ways to prevent the disease.
 
 Clinical Trials are studying several ways to improve lymphoma treatment, including:
  
 Targeted therapy drugs to identify and block cancer cell growth.
 New chemotherapy drugs and new methods to deliver them in different doses and sequences. 
 Lymphoma vaccines to treat early stage lymphoma or patients who are in remission.

What are brain tumors?,"A brain tumor is a group of abnormal cells that grows in or around the brain. Tumors can directly destroy healthy brain cells. They can also indirectly damage healthy cells by crowding other parts of the brain and causing inflammation, brain swelling, and pressure within the skull.
 Brain tumors are malignant or benign. A malignant tumor is also called brain cancer. It grows rapidly and often invades healthy areas of the brain. Benign brain tumors do not contain cancer cells and are usually slow growing.
 Brain tumors are primary or metastatic. Primary brain tumors begin within the brain. Metastatic tumors form when cancer cells located elsewhere in the body break away and travel to the brain. For this reason, metastatic brain tumors are almost always malignant, while primary brain tumors may be benign or malignant.
 Brain tumors are classified according to location, the type of tissue involved, whether they are malignant, and other factors. If a tumor is malignant, the tumor cells are examined under a microscope to identify the severity of the malignancy. Using this analysis, tumors are graded by their level of malignancy from least to most malignant. Factors that determine the tumor grade include:
 
 how fast the cells are growing
 how much blood is supplying the cells
 the presence of dead cells in the middle of the tumor (necrosis)
 if the cells are confined to a specific area
 how similar the cancerous cells are to normal cells.
 
 The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown. Environmental and genetic factors may cause some brain tumors. Prior exposure to therapeutic irradiation as a child seems to be a contributing cause in very few patients. Symptoms of a brain tumor include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, behavior changes, memory loss, and vision or hearing problems."
What are the available treatments for brain tumor,"Doctors use a variety of therapies to treat brain tumors. Treatment depends on tumor size, type, growth rate, brain location, and your general health. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted biological agents, or a combination thereof. Surgery (if safe) is generally the first treatment recommendation. This will rapidly reduce pressure in the brain. This website focuses on radiation therapy for brain tumors.
 Over the last few decades, researchers have developed new techniques to deliver radiation that targets the brain tumor while protecting nearby healthy tissues. These treatments include brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and radiosurgery.
 If your tumor is radiosensitive, your doctor may prescribe radiation therapy. Conventional radiation therapy aims external beams of x-rays, gamma
 rays or protons at the tumor to kill cancer cells and shrink brain tumors. Patients usually treatment over a period of several weeks. Your doctor may use whole brain radiation therapy if you have multiple tumors or tumors that cannot be easily targeted.
 Types of radiation therapy include:
 
 Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): an advanced mode of high-precision radiotherapy that uses computer-controlled x-ray accelerators. The accelerators conform and deliver a precise radiation dose to the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of the tumor. The machines control the intensity of the radiation beam to focus a higher dose on the tumor and minimize radiation exposure to healthy cells. 
 Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS): highly precise radiotherapy that directs narrow beams of radiation to the tumor from different angles. For this procedure, you may wear a rigid head frame. The frame minimizes head movement and serves as a point of reference for the radiation beams. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans help the doctor pinpoint tumor location. A computer helps the doctor regulate the radiation dose. Stereotactic radiotherapy is physically similar to radiosurgery, but it divides treatment into multiple sessions. This approach is best for large tumors or tumors within or close to critical brain structures that cannot tolerate a large radiation dose. See the Stereotactic radiosurgery page.
 Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT): radiotherapy that conforms a specific arrangement of x-ray beams to the tumor’s shape to maximize tumor dose and minimize exposure to normal tissue. This treatment is tailored to your specific anatomy and tumor location. Your doctor may use CT and/or MRI scanning to plan your treatment.
 Brachytherapy: the temporary placement of radioactive source(s) within the body to give an extra dose—or boost—of radiation to the area of the excision site or to any residual tumor.
 
 Doctors often prescribe surgery for primary brain tumors. A surgeon removes all or part of the tumor without causing severe damage to surrounding tissues. Surgery may also reduce pressure within the skull (called intracranial pressure) and ease symptoms when the tumor cannot be removed.
 Your treatment may use oral or intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. Combined chemotherapy and radiation (concurrent therapy) has become the standard of care for primary malignant brain tumors. Chemotherapy may slow down or kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. Doctors may use it before, during, or after surgery and/or radiotherapy to help destroy tumor cells and prevent them from returning. Your doctor may also prescribe radiosensitizers. These drugs may make radiation therapy more effective."
What happens during radiation therapy for brain tumor?,"For conventional radiation therapy, you will consult with a radiation oncologist —a doctor who specializes in radiation therapy. During the first visit, the oncologist will review the history of your illness and perform a physical exam. You may consult with other members of your treatment team at this time, too.
 After you and your doctor(s) decide on a course of treatment, you will begin treatment planning. During this first treatment planning phase, a radiation oncologist will simulate your radiation therapy treatment using either conventional x-rays or a CT scan. Most cases will require an MRI scan. Doctors use these exams to plan the type and direction of radiation beams they will use to treat the cancer.
 You will need to lie still on the treatment table during simulation, although no radiation therapy will be given at that point. The treatment team will usually create an immobilization mask at this time to prevent head movement. Typically, treatment begins one to two weeks after your treatment planning session. Planning and verifying your treatment plan will require significant medical physics before you begin treatment.
 During your actual radiation therapy treatment, you will lie on the treatment table without moving. A radiation technologist will administer the treatment prescribed by the radiation oncologist. The treatment will last only a few minutes, and you may see flashes of light or smell an odor during that time. You may also hear a noise from the treatment unit. If you undergo stereotactic radiosurgery, you may wear a rigid head frame. In this procedure, a CT or MRI scan will help the doctor pinpoint tumor location, and a computer will regulate the needed radiation dose. They doctor may take multiple images on the treatment machine to ensure everything is well aligned.
 Treatment planning sessions and your first radiation therapy treatments may take up to an hour. After that, treatments will usually last a few minutes and you will be in and out of the radiation department in 30 to 45 minutes for each session. Typically, treatments are given once a day, three to five days a week, for five to seven weeks. Treatments are usually not given on weekends.

What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for brain tumor?,"The side effects of radiation therapy to the brain may not occur until two to three weeks after the start of your therapy. Many people experience hair loss, but the amount varies from person to person. Hair may grow back once therapy is finished.
 Skin irritation is the second most frequently reported side effect. The skin around your ears and scalp may become dry, itchy, red, or tender. Do not try to treat this side effect on your own. Seek professionalism medical treatment as soon as it occurs. Fatigue is another possible side effect. The best way to fight fatigue is to get on a daily exercise regimen that is tolerable and sustainable, eat a healthy diet, and rely on friends and family for support. Your normal energy levels should return about six weeks after you finish your therapy. Fatigue may be the worst two to three weeks after you complete prolonged (multi-week) radiation treatment
 Edema (swelling of the brain) is also a common side effect. Tell your oncologist if you have a headache or a feeling of pressure. The doctor may prescribe medications to help reduce brain swelling, prevent seizures, or control pain. If you receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy at the same time, you may experience more severe side effects. Your doctor can suggest ways to ease these symptoms.
 Other possible side effects include:
 
 hearing problems
 nausea
 vomiting
 loss of appetite
 memory or speech problems
 headaches"
What are some of the possible risks or complications of radiation therapy for brain tumor?,"Radiation is a powerful weapon against cancer cells, but sometimes it kills healthy brain tissue as well. This severe side effect is called radiation necrosis. Necrosis (a late effect of high doses of radiation) can cause headaches, seizures, or even death in a small number of cases. This can occur six months to a few years after treatment. However, there is less risk of necrosis today because of newer, targeted radiation therapies and the emergence of powerful imaging, brain mapping and information technologies.
 Other complications include:
 
 neurologic deficits (this usually depends on the area of the brain being treated)
 cognitive problems
 seizures
 headaches
 return of tumor growth
 
 
 In children, radiation may damage the pituitary gland and other parts of the brain. This could cause learning problems or slow growth and development. Additionally, radiation during childhood increases the risk of developing tumors later in life. Researchers are studying chemotherapy as an alternative to radiation therapy in children with brain tumors."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for brain tumor?,"Regular follow-up treatment is extremely important after brain tumor treatment. Besides regular physical and neurological exams and blood tests, you may need periodic MRI, MR spectroscopy, perfusion or diffusion MRI, and/or CT exams. Doctors rarely use positron emission tomography (PET) scans in brain tumor patients. However, they may use PET to monitor disease outside of the brain (extracranial disease). Your doctor may also recommend home care, occupational or vocational therapy, pain management, physical therapy, and participation in support groups.
 This follow-up care will help your doctor to:
 
 spot any sign that the tumor is returning
 monitor the health of your brain
 identify and treat the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy
 detect the presence of other types of cancer at the earliest possible stage"
Are there any new developments in treating brain tumor?,"Over the past decade, improvements in fractionated and stereotactic radiotherapy have improved survival rates and quality of life for brain tumor patients. A few experimental drugs and therapies also show promise in clinical trials, including:
 
 Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that interfere with the growth of blood vessels in the tumor. By reducing its blood supply, they “starve” the tumor of the nutrients and oxygen it needs to grow. This is also called anti-angiogenetic therapy.
 Immunotherapy promotes the immune response against tumor antigens (tumor substances/molecules that trigger the immune system). There are many different types of immunotherapy approved for use, Many others are still undergoing clinical trial.
 New classes of biological agents targeted against various aspects of tumor cell signaling or metabolism.
 Enhanced drug delivery methods (e.g. convection-enhanced delivery) are undergoing clinical trials.
 Emerging re-irradiation (repeated administration of radiotherapy) treatment protocols for recurrent brain tumors are now available (e.g., re-irradiation with bevacizumab for glioblastoma). 
 
 Radiofrequency tumor treating fields (TTF) are now available to treat glioblastoma. This treatment sends mild electrical fields into the tumor and disrupts the cancer cells’ ability to grow and divide. Electrodes placed on the scalp deliver the electrical fields to the tumor. A radiofrequency generator with a battery backpack power the fields. This treatment does not use radiation. While it may be of value, it does require significant commitment to wear a treatment apparatus throughout the day and at night. This may be a significant lifestyle modification.
 Clinical Trials

Who operates the MRI-Guided Linac?,Your radiation oncologist prescribes the proper treatment volume and dosage. The medical physicist and the dosimetrist figure out how to deliver the prescribed dose. They also figure the amount of time it will take the accelerator to deliver that dose. Radiation therapists run the MRI scanner and the linear accelerator and give patients their daily treatments.
How does MRI-guided LINAC ensure patient safety?,"The MR-LINAC is an FDA-cleared device. It has built-in safety measures to ensure that it will deliver the dose as prescribed. Medical physicists routinely check it to ensure it is working properly.
 The powerful magnetic field of the MR system can attract objects made from certain metals. This may cause them to move suddenly and with great force. Therefore, great care is taken to ensure that no one brings outside objects such as ferromagnetic screwdrivers and oxygen tanks into the MR system room.
 All MRI facilities have screening procedures and protocols to identify any potential hazards. These steps ensure that the MRI technologist and radiologist know about the presence of any metallic objects. They can then take precautions as needed.
 Some MRI exams involve the use of a contrast material known as gadolinium. It helps improve the information seen on the MR images. Unlike the contrast materials used in x-ray exams or computed tomography (CT) scans, a gadolinium contrast agent does not contain iodine. Therefore, it rarely causes an allergic reaction or other problem. 
 Before receiving a gadolinium contrast agent, tell the MRI technologist and/or radiologist if you have a history of:
 
 kidney disease
 kidney failure
 kidney transplant
 liver disease
 related conditions. 
 
 If you are unsure about the presence of these conditions, please discuss these matters with the staff or radiologist prior to the MRI.
 See the MRI Safety page for more details.
 Before treatment, the radiation oncologist develops a plan. The radiation dosimetrist and medical physicist help with the plan. The treatment team performs quality-assurance procedures to ensure that they deliver the treatment as planned.
 Quality assurance of the linear accelerator is crucial. The accelerator has several systems built in so that it will not deliver a higher dose than prescribed. Each morning before any patient undergoes treatment, the radiation therapist checks the machine. This ensures that the radiation intensity is uniform across the beam and that it is working properly. In addition, the medical physicist conducts more detailed monthly and annual checks of the accelerator.
 Modern linear accelerators also have internal checking systems. These systems do not allow the machine to be turned on unless all the prescribed treatment requirements are met.
 During treatment, the radiation therapist observes the patient on a closed-circuit television monitor. There is also a microphone in the treatment room so that the patient can speak with staff if needed. 
 Safety of the staff operating the linear accelerator is also important. The linear accelerator sits in a room with lead and concrete walls. This shields the high-energy x-rays. This means that no one outside of the room is exposed to the x-rays. The radiation therapist must turn on the accelerator from outside the treatment room. Because the accelerator only emits radiation when it is turned on, the risk of accidental exposure is extremely low."
What's breast cancer,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in American women. It is now possible to detect most breast cancers at a very early stage. With early detection and improved treatments more women are surviving breast cancer. In fact, breast cancer survival has increased steadily over the last five decades. Today, women have more treatment options than ever before.
 See the Mammography, Breast Cancer Screening and Breast Cancer disease pages for more information and to learn about early detection."
What are the treatment options for breast cancer?,"Treatment options overview
 Surgical treatment options include mastectomy or breast conservation therapy (BCT). Mastectomy is an operation to remove the entire breast, and usually the entire nipple. Often an axillary (armpit) sampling is also done which removes the glands under the arm called axillary nodes. The surgeon may evaluate just one or two nodes (sentinel node/s) or may perform a more extensive axillary dissection to check for disease spread. Mastectomy sometimes requires a hospital stay. A drainage tube is sometimes temporarily left in the surgical cavity after a mastectomy to help prevent fluid accumulation. Women who undergo a mastectomy have the option of breast reconstruction.
 Breast conservation surgery removes the breast tumor and a margin of surrounding normal tissues. It is also known by other names: lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy or quadrantectomy. Radiation therapy usually follows lumpectomy to eliminate any microscopic cancer cells in the
 remaining breast tissue. The purpose of breast conservation therapy is to give women the same cure rate they would have if they were treated with a mastectomy but to leave the breast intact, with an appearance and texture as close as possible to what they had before treatment. The surgeon may remove some lymph nodes by performing a sentinel lymph node procedure or axillary dissection at the same time as the lumpectomy procedure or later. It is estimated that 75 percent to 80 percent of patients can be treated with breast conservation therapy rather than mastectomy with excellent results. Years of clinical study have proven that breast conservation therapy offers the same cure rate as mastectomy.
 Your radiation therapy procedure might include:
 
 External Beam Therapy - see
  the External Beam Therapy page
 
 Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy - see
  the Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy page
 
 Brachytherapy (interstitial, single catheter or balloon-based) - the temporary placement of radioactive materials within the breast to treat partial breast only or employed to give an extra dose of radiation to the area of the excision site (called a ""boost"") - see the Brachytherapy page .
 
 Patients may also have chemotherapy or hormonal therapy if there is a risk that the cancer may have spread outside
 of the breast to other body organs."
Is radiation therapy necessary if the margins of the removed tissue are clear for breast cancer,"Many studies have reviewed this approach for patients with invasive cancers. Nearly all show that the risk of relapse in the breast is much higher when radiation is not used (20 percent to 40 percent) than when it is (five percent to 10 percent). When breast cancer re-occurs locally (in the breast) after breast conservation surgery, patients may then need to have a mastectomy to be cured. Because having breast cancer reappear in this way is a very traumatic psychological event, and because not everyone who has a recurrence in the breast can be cured, radiation therapy after lumpectomy has become a standard part of breast-conserving therapy.
 There are several recent studies in which older patients with small, favorable invasive cancers have had a low risk of local relapse when treated with lumpectomy and hormonal therapy without radiation therapy. There is still uncertainty about the long-term results with this approach or about which individuals will do best without radiation therapy. This issue should be discussed in detail with your doctor.
 For patients with noninvasive cancer (known as ""ductal carcinoma in situ"" or DCIS) matters are more complicated. Lumpectomy without radiation works well for many patients. However, there is disagreement on who can be treated safely with just a lumpectomy. This should be discussed in detail with your doctor. Sometimes, a genomic test may be ordered on the DCIS specimen to help patients make a more informed decision on whether or not to undergo radiation therapy. These tests look at a series of genes in the tumor itself. They may provide some information about a patient's tumor recurrence risk with and without radiation therapy. These tests are new for DCIS and not all tumors are eligible for this test."
How to decide between mastectomy and breast conservation therapy?,"Breast conservation therapy is often used for patients with DCIS (Stage 0) or early-stage invasive breast cancers (called Stage I and Stage II in the classification system). It can also be used for more advanced disease that has responded well to neoadjuvant treatments. Some of the reasons to not have breast conservation therapy include: personal preference; increased risk of complications from radiation therapy in individuals with certain rare medical conditions such as certain autoimmune disorders; surgery that would require removing a large amount of diseased breast tissue that would lead to a poor cosmetic result; and tumors that are more likely than average to have a relapse in the breast with breast conservation therapy. Women who are carriers for the “breast cancer gene” (BRCA 1 or 2) may sometimes elect for a double mastectomy.
 Most patients may choose a treatment based on other factors, such as convenience (for example, how far you must travel to receive radiation therapy) or personal preference (wanting to preserve one's breast, wanting a quicker recovery with a lumpectomy, feeling safer if you undergo a mastectomy or being very worried about the possible side effects from radiation therapy). Most women prefer to keep their breast if this is possible to do safely, but there is no right answer that is best for everyone. This decision is one that is ideally made in partnership between a patient and her physician. In some cases, a pre-surgical consultation with a radiation oncologist may be helpful in answering questions about breast-conserving therapy.
 Nearly all physicians will recommend patients be treated with mastectomy instead of breast conservation therapy when the risk of recurrence in the breast is more than 20 percent. This is the case if the tumor is large or multifocal (has more than one focus). This situation occurs for only a small number of women, however."
What are the cosmetic results of breast conservation therapy?,"Eighty percent to 90 percent of women treated with modern surgery and radiotherapy techniques have excellent or good cosmetic results; that is, little or no change in the treated breast in size, shape, texture or appearance compared with what it was like before treatment.
 Patients with large breasts seem to have greater shrinkage of the breast after radiation therapy than do patients with smaller breasts. However, this problem usually can be overcome with the use of higher x-ray energies or with IMRT. Partial breast radiation using external radiation therapy or brachytherapy can also be considered if the patient has a small early-stage tumor. This treatment is still undergoing clinical investigation. Certain single institution studies on brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation (IORT) have shown some promising results. You would need to discuss this with your doctor before or shortly after surgery to determine if you qualify for partial breast radiation."
What is the prognosis after breast cancer recurrence?,"Many patients with a recurrence of breast cancer can be successfully treated, often with methods other than radiation if radiation was used in the initial treatment. For patients treated initially for invasive breast cancer, five percent to 10 percent will be found to have distant metastases at the time of discovery of the breast recurrence. The same proportion will have recurrences that are too extensive to be operated on. While in these cases the patient's disease can often be managed over a period of years, the goals of treatment change from obtaining a cure to preventing further progression or managing symptoms. Five-year cure rates for patients with relapse after breast conservation therapy are approximately 60 percent to 75 percent if the relapse is confined to the breast and a mastectomy is then performed.
 For patients treated initially for DCIS, about one-half of recurrences are invasive and one-half noninvasive DCIS. Long-term control rates following recurrence after initial breast conservation therapy have been high, often over 90 percent."
What happens during radiation therapy for breast cancer,Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles. When radiation is used at therapeutic doses (many times those used for x-ray imaging exams) it can destroy abnormal cells that cause cancer and other illnesses.
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for breast cancer?,"There are usually no immediate side effects from each radiation treatment given to the breast. Patients do not develop nausea or hair loss on the head from radiation therapy to the breast.
 Most patients develop mild fatigue that builds up gradually over the course of therapy. This slowly goes away one to two months following the radiation therapy. Most patients develop dull aches or sharp shooting pains in the breast that may last for a few seconds or minutes. It is rare for patients to need any medication for this. The most common side effect needing attention is skin reaction. Most patients develop reddening, dryness and
 itching of the skin after a few weeks. Some patients develop substantial irritation.
 Skin care recommendations include:
 
 Keeping the skin clean using gentle soap and warm but not hot water
 Avoiding extreme temperatures while bathing
 Avoiding trauma to the skin and sun exposure (use clothing as a barrier or a sunscreen with at least SPF 30)
 Avoiding shaving the treatment area with a razor blade (use an electric razor if necessary)
 Avoiding use of perfumes, cosmetics, after-shave or deodorants in the treatment area (use cornstarch with or without baking soda in place of deodorants)
 Using only recommended unscented creams or lotions after daily treatment
 
 Some patients develop a sunburn-like reaction with blistering and peeling of the skin, called ""moist desquamation."" This usually occurs in the fold under the breast or in the fold between the breast and the arm, or sometimes in the area given a radiation boost. Most people with a limited area of moist desquamation can continue treatment without interruption. Sometimes, topical medications (those applied to the surface of the body) are prescribed. When treatment must be interrupted, the skin usually heals enough to allow radiation to be resumed in five to seven days. Skin reactions usually heal completely within a few weeks of completing radiotherapy."
What are some of the possible risks or complications of radiation therapy for breast cancer,"Minor complications include:
 
 Slight swelling of the breast during radiotherapy. This usually goes away within six to 12 months.
 The skin becomes darker during the course of radiotherapy, similar to tanning from the sun. In most cases, this also fades gradually over six to 12 months.
 Most women will have aches or pains from time to time in the treated breast or the muscles surrounding the breast, even years after treatment. The reason why this happens is not clear; however, these pains are harmless, although annoying. They are not usually a sign that the cancer is reappearing.
 Rarely, patients may develop a rib fracture years following treatment. This occurs in less than one percent of patients treated by modern approaches. These heal slowly by themselves.
 
 More serious complications include:
 
 Radiation therapy given to the axillary lymph nodes can increase the risk of patients developing arm swelling (""lymphedema"") following axillary (armpit) dissection.
 Radiation therapy given to the axillary lymph nodes may rarely cause numbness, tingling or even pain and loss of strength in the hand and arm years after treatment.
 Some patients develop ""radiation pneumonitis,"" a lung reaction that causes a cough, shortness of breath and fevers three to nine months after completing treatment. Fortunately,
  it is usually mild enough that no specific treatment is needed and it goes away within two to four weeks with no long-term complications.
 Radiotherapy may damage the heart. Fortunately, modern radiation techniques treat much less of the heart than treatments used in the past. Current studies have found no increased risk of serious heart disease in patients treated with modern techniques even 10 to 20 years after radiotherapy treatment was given. However, there is still some uncertainty about the risks of radiation causing heart disease for individuals who smoke or have pre-existing heart disease, or for those who receive certain chemotherapy drugs. It is likely that such risks will also be found to be very small. Fortunately, newer radiation techniques treat patients in the prone position (patient lying on their stomach, pulling the breast away from the heart) or use deep inspiration technique (taking a deep breath and pulling the chest away from the heart during radiation therapy). Both techniques may further reduce radiation related heart injury.
 Women age 45 or younger at the time of treatment may have a slightly increased risk (by a few percent at most) of developing cancer of the other breast with time, compared with the risk they would have if they did not undergo radiation. There is a very small risk (perhaps one in 1,000 individuals) that cancers may develop five, 10, 20 or more years later in the skin, muscle, bone or lung directly in the area of treatment.
 Patients may rarely develop a breakdown of the skin or such severe pain in the breast that surgery is needed for treatment."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for breast cancer?,"The major goal of follow-up is, if possible, to detect and treat recurrences in the irradiated breast or lymph nodes and new cancers developing later in either breast before they can spread to other parts of the body. The
 routine use of bone scans, chest x-rays, blood tests and other tests to detect the possible spread to other organs in patients without symptoms does not appear to be useful. Your physician will determine a follow-up
 schedule for you. This may include a physical exam every few months for the first several years after treatment and then every six to 12 months or so after that. Annual follow-up mammograms are an important part of your care. If symptoms or clinical circumstances suggest a recurrence, diagnostic tests such as blood tests, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest x-ray (CXR), or bone scan may be needed."
Are there any new developments in treating breast cancer?,"Partial breast irradiation with brachytherapy and IORT or IMRT is being explored and compared to whole breast irradiation. Additionally, hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy (shorter course of radiation therapy at higher doses per day) is becoming more common in North America.

What is pancreatic cancer?,"Pancreatic cancer begins in the pancreas, an organ located deep in the abdomen behind the stomach. The pancreas releases hormones called insulin and glucagon to help the body process sugar. It also produces enzymes to help the body digest fats, carbohydrates and proteins.
 Pancreatic cancer affects about 46,000 Americans a year, making it the twelfth most common type of cancer in the United States. Pancreatic cancer usually does not produce symptoms in the early stages of the disease, and its cells do not produce substances that are easily measured. As a result, patients often experience no symptoms until the tumor has spread into surrounding organs. Eight out of ten patients are diagnosed after the cancer has spread (or metastasized) beyond the pancreas. Research is ongoing to help better understand the disease and to identify new and more effective treatments."
What are the treatment options for pancreatic cancer?,"Treatment options overview
 Pancreatic cancer is usually treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The type of treatment depends on the stage of the tumor (how far it has spread) and how close it is to blood vessels. Your physician will help you weigh the treatment options as they relate to your age, overall health and personal preferences.
 Standard treatment options include:
 Surgery
 Patients with pancreatic cancer often have some form of surgery as part of their treatment plan. These surgeries are complicated and patients are urged to choose a hospital that performs pancreatic surgeries on a regular basis. The pancreas is divided into three parts: the head, the body and the tail. The type of surgery performed depends on the location of the tumor within the pancreas and whether the tumor has affected blood vessels and other organs near the pancreas.
 
 The Whipple Procedure: This surgery is performed on tumors is located in the head of the pancreas. During this surgery, the head of the pancreas is removed as well as the first part of the small intestine (also known as the duodenum), the gallbladder and part of the bile duct. Sometimes parts of the stomach and nearby lymph nodes are also removed. The remaining part of the pancreas, the stomach and the intestine are reconnected so you can still digest food.
 Distal Pancreatectomy: This surgery is performed on tumors that are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. During this surgery, the body and tail are removed. The spleen is often removed as well.
 Total Pancreatectomy: This surgery is performed on tumors located in all three areas of the pancreas. During this surgery, the entire pancreas is removed as well as the gallbladder, spleen, nearby lymph nodes and parts of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct. It is possible to live without a pancreas but patients will need insulin treatment and enzyme replacement for the rest of their lives.
 
 Sometimes, patients may have tumors blocking the gallbladder or the stomach, and surgery may be performed to bypass the blockages. While these surgeries don't eliminate the cancerous tumor, they can greatly improve quality of life for the patient.
 Radiation Therapy
 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep the tumors from growing. Some patients undergo radiation therapy in order to shrink tumors before surgery. Three types of radiation are typically used to treat pancreatic cancer: external beam therapy (EBT), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and proton therapy. Radiation therapies are often used in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy.
 
 External beam therapy (EBT): During EBT, high-energy x-ray beams are delivered to the tumor. Beams are usually generated by a linear accelerator and targeted to destroy cancer cells while sparing surrounding normal tissues. Most pancreatic cancer patients receive a type of external beam therapy called Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). IMRT is a type of 3-D radiation that uses linear accelerators to safely and painlessly deliver precise radiation doses to a tumor while minimizing the dose to surrounding normal tissue. EBT typically requires daily treatment over a period of three to six weeks. See the External Beam Therapy page for more information. See the Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy page for more information about IMRT.
 Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT): SBRT is a newer type of radiation therapy which uses special equipment to deliver precisely-targeted radiation in fewer high-dose treatments than traditional EBT. The total dose of radiation is divided into smaller ""fractionated"" doses given over several days instead of several weeks. This helps preserve healthy tissue. The use of SBRT for pancreatic cancer is only used in specialized cancer centers. See the Stereotactic body radiotherapy page for more information about SBRT.
 Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton beam radiation therapy delivers radiation to the tumor in a much more confined way than conventional radiation therapy. It allows the radiation oncologist to deliver a higher dose to the tumor while still minimizing side effects. This can be especially helpful in treating pancreatic cancer since the pancreas is located so closely to other essential organs. Proton beam radiation therapy still requires daily treatment over a period of four to five weeks and is only available at specialized cancer centers. See the Proton Therapy page for more information.
 
 Chemotherapy
 This treatment involves the use of drugs given intravenously (by vein) or orally to kill cancer cells or to keep them from dividing and multiplying. Chemotherapy may be used alone or in combination with radiation. Like radiation therapy, chemotherapy can ease symptoms and increase survival for patients with tumors that have spread (metastasized). Patients usually receive chemotherapy treatment sessions over a set period of time with breaks in between to alleviate potential side effects, such as abnormal blood-cell counts, fatigue, diarrhea, mouth sores, and a weakened immune system.
 Newer, advanced chemotherapy options have recently been developed. These newer options help avoid damaging normal, healthy tissues while stopping cancer cells from spreading and multiplying.
 How can I choose from among the options?"
How to choose treatments for pancreatic cancer?,"In addition to talking with family and friends, you will need a team of doctors to help advise you. This team will include a medical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, a surgeon and a palliative (pain) care doctor. A medical oncologist specializes in using chemotherapy to treat cancer. A radiation oncologist specializes in using radiation to treat cancer. The surgeon removes cancer or performs surgical procedures to bypass blockages from pancreatic cancer tumors. The palliative care doctor specializes in reducing or eliminating pain and other symptoms associated with the cancer.
 You and your care team will create a treatment plan, which will be determined in part by the stage and severity of your cancer. Most patients with pancreatic cancer will be treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. It is also possible for patients to choose no treatment if the cancer is very advanced. These patients will work closely with the palliative care doctor to minimize pain and preserve their quality of life."
"If I choose surgery, will I need radiation therapy or vice versa?","Pancreatic cancer is rarely diagnosed in its early stages. Therefore, most patients will undergo some combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In many cases, the goal of the surgery is not to remove the cancerous tumor but to help reduce pain and other symptoms caused by the tumor. A combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy is often used to shrink a tumor prior to surgery or to keep a tumor from growing. Radiation therapy may also be used to prevent the tumor from coming back."
What happens during radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer?,Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles (protons). Radiation at high doses can destroy abnormal cells at the microscopic level. Patients will hear some electrical noise and see lights on the machine but will not feel the radiation during treatment. Radiation treatment is typically given to patients in multiple sessions over a course of weeks.
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer?,"After multiple radiation therapy sessions, patients often become tired. While adequate rest is important, doctors usually advise patients to try to stay as active as possible. Patients may have an upset stomach, diarrhea or loose stools, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite while being treated with radiation therapy. Sometimes patients will have skin changes or irritation in the area where the radiation beam enters the body. Patients may also experience low levels of red blood cells and/or white blood cells, increasing their risk of infection. These side effects are generally short term, lasting two to three weeks after treatment."
What kind of treatment follow-up for pancreatic cancer?,"Once your pancreatic cancer treatment is complete, you and your treatment team will decide on a follow-up plan. Patients with early stage cancers and neuroendocrine tumors will typically follow up with a medical oncologist or family doctor every six months for the two years after treatment and then every year after. All pancreatic cancer patients will need to have regular blood tests. If the pancreas no longer functions properly or has been removed, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and insulin treatment may be required. Living with cancer can be emotionally difficult for you and your loved ones. Finding a therapist who specializes in treating cancer patients is highly recommended."

What is cervical cancer?,"Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor that starts in the cells of the cervix. This is the lower part of the uterus that connects the uterus and the vagina. According to the American Cancer Society, cervical cancer is most frequently diagnosed in women between the ages of 35 and 44.
 Most cervical cancers are the result of a previous infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV may be spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. HPV vaccination is recommended in adolescents age 11-12 prior to first sexual encounter. However, it is approved for adults up to the age of 26 and considered appropriate in some people up through 45. It is important to note that both men and women can receive the HPV vaccine. For women, regular gynecological care will also help reduce your risk for cervical cancer through routine pap smears and HPV testing. See the Cervical Cancer page for more information."
What are the available treatments for cervical cancer?,"Treatment options overview
 Cervical cancer treatment options depend on the stage of the tumor. The stage indicates if and how far cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Your doctor may use CT, MRI, chest X-ray or a PET scan to identify the stage of your cancer. This will help determine what treatments are available to you.
 Treatment options include:
 
 Surgery
 Radiation Therapy
 Chemotherapy
 Targeted Therapy
 
 Your treatment may use one or more of these options. Your doctor will weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each option as they relate to your age, overall health, future childbearing plans and personal preferences.
 Surgery:
 For Stage 0 or precancerous disease, patients typically undergo one of the following procedures. These procedures allow women to become pregnant in the future:
 
 Cryosurgery: During this procedure, gas is used to cool a metal probe. The probe is placed directly onto the cervix where it freezes and kills abnormal cells. For more information see Thermal Ablation for Tumor Treatment.
 Laser Surgery: This procedure uses a focused laser beam to burn off abnormal cervical cells. It may also be used to remove a small piece of the cervix for further lab testing.
 LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure)/Conization: This procedure uses a wire loop heated by an electric current to remove abnormal cells from the cervix. In conization, the surgeon uses a scalpel to remove a cone shaped piece of abnormal tissue.
 
 Under special circumstances, early stage cervical cancer patients, who want to become pregnant in the future may undergo:
 
 
 Conization (described above).
 Simple trachelectomy: This surgery removes the cervix.
 Radical trachelectomy: In addition to removing the cervix, a margin of the vagina and tissue next to the cervix (or parametrium) is removed but the uterus is kept intact. Pelvic lymph nodes also are removed. The surgeon places a ""purse-string"" stitch (or cerclage) at the lower end of the uterus. This allows for the possibility of the patient carrying a pregnancy to term. Such a pregnancy would likely be considered high-risk.
 
 
 The decision to proceed with surgery in patients who do not want to become pregnant depends on stage. Surgical options include:
 
 Simple hysterectomy: This surgery removes the uterus and cervix but leaves the structures surrounding the uterus intact. No lymph nodes are removed. This eliminates any possibility of a future pregnancy.
 Radical hysterectomy: This surgery removes the uterus, cervix, upper part of the vagina and some ligaments and tissue near the uterus. Pelvic lymph nodes also are removed. The ovaries are generally not removed. This eliminates any possibility of a future pregnancy.
 Hysterectomies can be performed through:
 
 the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy)
 a large incision in the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy) or
 a small incision in the abdomen (laparoscopic hysterectomy, which includes robotic assistance).
 
 Any removal of the uterus prevents a woman from becoming pregnant in the future.
 Radiation therapy:
 Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Two types of radiation therapy — external beam therapy (EBT), brachytherapy or both — are typically used to treat cervical cancer. Radiation therapies are often used together or in combination with surgery.
 
 External Beam Therapy (EBT): EBT delivers high-energy x-ray or electron beams to the tumor. Beams are usually generated by a linear accelerator and targeted to destroy cancer cells while sparing surrounding normal tissues. Many patients receive a type of EBT called Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). IMRT is a type of 3-D radiation that safely and painlessly delivers a precise radiation dose to a tumor while minimizing the dose to surrounding normal tissue. EBT typically requires daily treatment over a period of four to six weeks. See the External Beam Therapy page and the Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy page for more information.
 Brachytherapy or internal radiation therapy: Brachytherapy uses a delivery device to place radioactive material inside the patient on a temporary or permanent basis. This kind of radiation only travels short distances as opposed to EBT. It allows your doctor to use a higher total dose of radiation to treat a smaller area in less time than EBT.
 Cervical cancer brachytherapy is known as intracavitary brachytherapy. A device containing radioactive material is inserted into the vagina, the cervix and sometimes into the tissue surrounding the cervix. There are two types of intracavitary brachytherapy:
  
 Low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy: LDR is performed in a hospital setting and requires a patient to stay overnight for several days. Patients are typically given medication to help them relax during the procedure, which is performed in an operating room usually under general anesthesia. For women who still have a uterus, the delivery devices are known as a tandem and ovoid applicator. The tandem is inserted through the cervix and into the uterus, and the ovoid is placed near the cervix. The radioactive sources are then inserted into the tandem and ovoid. To protect healthy tissue, sterilized material is often placed around the applicator to push the bladder and rectum away from the treatment area. Once the device is in place and the radiation material is inserted, the patient is moved to a shielded hospital room where the radiation is delivered over a period of two to three days. During this time, the patient will receive medication to remain comfortable. Trained nurses and physicians will care for the patient over the course of treatment but will take precautions to avoid radiation exposure.
 High-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy: This treatment may be delivered on an outpatient basis, although on occasion the device that is implanted will remain in place overnight and may require a brief hospital stay. HDR brachytherapy requires several treatments, usually separated by a period of days or even up to a week. Insertion of the HDR brachytherapy device (most frequently a tandem and ovoid applicator) may be performed under general anesthesia or moderate sedation. The patient typically undergoes a CT or MRI scan to help the radiation oncologist plan where the radiation should be delivered. The tandem is inserted through the cervix and into the uterus, and the ovoid is placed near the cervix. The patient is then moved to a shielded room and connected to the source of radiation, which is delivered through the applicator and removed after several minutes. Frequently a few treatments will be delivered, spaced over a period of a day or two. There is no radioactivity in the radiation applicator between treatments. The patient will stay in a standard (non-shielded) hospital room in-between treatments. Patients are given medication to help them relax during the procedure. Intracavitary brachytherapy may be used for women who have had radical hysterectomies and who no longer have a uterus and cervix. Instead of inserting a tandem and ovoid, a shorter device called a cylinder is placed into the vagina. A tube with radioactive material is then placed through the cylinder to deliver the radiation locally. See the Brachytherapy page for more information.
 
 
 
 Chemotherapy:
 This treatment administers drugs intravenously (by vein) or by mouth to kill cancer cells or to keep them from reproducing. IV chemotherapy is typically used in combination with radiation to decrease the chance of the disease returning elsewhere in the body. When chemotherapy is given with radiation for cervical cancer, it is given at a lower dose. This has been shown to help the radiation therapy work better. Like radiation therapy, chemotherapy can ease symptoms and increase survival for patients with tumors that have spread (metastasized). Patients usually receive chemotherapy over a set period of time with breaks in between to ease potential side effects. These effects may include abnormal blood-cell counts, fatigue, diarrhea, mouth sores and a compromised immune system.
 Newer, advanced chemotherapy options help avoid damaging healthy tissue while stopping cancer cells from spreading and reproducing.
 Targeted therapy/monoclonal antibodies and immunotherapy:
 Targeted therapy gives small amounts of manmade ""monoclonal"" antibodies to patients through intravenous (IV) infusion. Monoclonal antibodies mimic the body's natural antibodies that identify and fight foreign objects such as viruses and bacteria. Once inside the body, monoclonal antibodies latch onto substances on the surface of cancer cells. This kills the cancer cells or blocks their growth. Bevacizumab (Avastin®) is a common monoclonal antibody used for cervical cancer. Once inside the body, it binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor and helps prevent the growth of new blood vessels that feed cancer cells. This therapy is generally used to treat cancer that has spread outside the cervix and its immediate area. It is also used to treat recurrent cervical cancer. Recent data suggests that Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), an immune therapy, can be used in cervical cancers that make too much of the protein PDL-1. PDL-1 binds to the protein PD-1, which keeps your body from killing cancer cells. Pembrolizumab works by blocking this attachment. This therapy is used to treat cancer that has stopped responding to chemotherapy, cannot be removed by surgery, or has returned."
How to choose the treatment for cervical cancer?,"In addition to talking with family and friends, you will need a team of doctors to help advise you. This team will include your gynecologist, a gynecologist oncologist, and a radiation oncologist. A gynecologist oncologist specializes in women's reproductive cancers. The gynecologist oncologist surgically removes cancer or helps radiation oncologists implant radioactive materials. A radiation oncologist uses radiation to treat cancer. You and your care team will create your treatment plan. Your plan will mostly be determined by the stage and severity of your cancer. It will also depend on your future plans for pregnancy. Early stage cervical cancer is typically treated with surgery or radiation combined with chemotherapy. Advanced or recurrent cervical cancers are typically treated with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy. Sometimes, advanced cervical cancer patients will only receive chemotherapy."
What happens during radiation therapy for cervical cancer?,"Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays (photons). Used at high doses (many times those used for x-ray imaging exams), it can destroy cancer cells with each treatment. This happens at a microscopic level. Patients do not feel the radiation during treatment. They will only hear some electrical noise from the machine and may notice safety warning lights in the room."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for cervical cancer?,"As treatment progresses, you may become tired. Adequate rest is important, you should try to stay as active as you can. You may have upset stomach, diarrhea or loose stools (if radiation is given to the pelvis or abdomen), nausea and vomiting during EBT. Some patients will have skin changes or irritation in the area where the radiation has passed through the skin to the cancer. If the irritation leads to peeling, you must be careful to clean and protect the area to avoid infection.
 Other side effects from EBT include:
 
 Radiation cystitis: irritation to the bladder, causing an urge to urinate often.
 Vaginal pain: increased sensitivity and soreness in the vagina, which can also result in discharge.
 Menstrual changes: radiation to the pelvis can affect the ovaries and often result in menstrual changes or early menopause.
 Low blood counts: radiation can affect how your body is functioning overall. This can result in low levels of red blood cells and/or white blood cells.
 
 Women undergoing brachytherapy often see similar side effects to those associated with EBT. These may include fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, irritation of the bladder and low blood counts. Also, because the radiation used in brachytherapy only travels a short distance, the vagina and the vulva may become red and sore and have a discharge. Patients often receive brachytherapy and EBT close together. This may make it more difficult to tell which treatment is causing the side effects.
 These side effects generally last two to three weeks after treatment is over. However, there are some long-term side effects that may or may not resolve.
 
 Vaginal stenosis: Both EBT and brachytherapy can cause scar tissue to form in the vagina. The scar tissue can make the vagina narrower (called stenosis), less able to stretch, or shorter. This can make sexual intercourse painful.
 Vaginal dryness: Vaginal dryness can be a long-term side effect from both EBT and brachytherapy. Estrogen creams are often used to help improve the dryness, especially if the radiation treatment results in early menopause.
 Irregular bowel movements that may be more frequent or urgent.
 Bowel obstruction that could require surgery to fix.
 Bladder damage that could cause bleeding in the urine.
 Weakened bones: Radiation to the pelvis can weaken the bones. This can put a woman at high risk of fractures. Hip fractures are the most common fracture seen in women, typically within the first few years after radiation. Bone density tests are recommended to monitor this risk. See the Bone Density Scan page for more information.
 Swelling of the leg(s): If pelvic lymph nodes are treated with radiation, it can lead to fluid drainage problems in the leg. Some women experience swelling in the leg, a condition called lymphedema. Non-invasive treatments for lymphedema are available.
 Early menopause and infertility: Radiation therapy is likely to cause early menopause and permanent infertility. Women of child-bearing age who may be pregnant or wish to become pregnant should talk to their doctors. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of hormone-replacement therapy as well."
What kind of treatment follow-up for cervical cancer?,"Once treatment is complete, you and your treatment team will decide on a follow-up plan. Early stage cancers will likely require follow up with your gynecologist oncologist. These appointments should be done every three months for the next two years and every six months for the following three years. Exams are performed annually thereafter. You will also need to have an annual pap smear test (including patients who have had a hysterectomy). Patients with more advanced cancer will need to be followed by both your gynecologist oncologist and radiation oncologist. These appointments will start within weeks of finishing your treatment to address any side effects. Once it is determined that the treatment has worked, your visits will be spaced further apart. At these visits, your doctor may order PET or CT scans. See the PET/CT Scan page for more information."

What is a Radiation Oncologist?,"Radiation oncologists are physicians who oversee the care of each cancer patient undergoing radiation treatment. After determining whether a patient is a candidate for radiation therapy, they review the side effects and benefits of treatment with the patient. Next, they develop and prescribe each cancer patient's radiation treatment plan and make sure that every treatment is accurately given. They monitor the patient's progress and adjust treatment to make sure patients receive quality care. Radiation oncologists also help identify and treat any side effects of radiation therapy. They work closely with other physicians and all members of the radiation oncology team. Radiation oncologists have completed four years of college, four years of medical school, one year of general medical training, then four years of residency (specialty) training in radiation oncology. They have extensive training in the safe use of radiation to treat disease. If they pass a special examination, they are certified by the American Board of Radiology. They participate in maintenance of certification, a process that ensures that they are up to date on advances in the field. Patients should ask if their doctor is board certified."
What is the role of a Therapeutic Medical Physicist in radiation therapy?,"A therapeutic medical physicist is a qualified medical physicist who works directly with the doctor in treatment planning and delivery. Therapeutic medical physicists oversee the work of dosimetrists and help ensure that complex treatments are properly tailored for each patient. They are responsible for developing and directing quality control programs for equipment and procedures that ensure the equipment works properly. They also take precise measurements of radiation beam characteristics and do other safety tests on a regular basis. Therapeutic medical physicists have doctorates or master's degrees and have completed four years of college, two to four years of graduate school and typically one to two years of clinical physics training. If they pass a special examination, they are certified by the American Board of Radiology or the American Board of Medical Physics. They participate in maintenance of certification, a process that ensures that they are up to date on advances in the field."
Who is the radiation therapist,"Radiation therapists work with radiation oncologists. They administer the daily radiation treatment under the doctor's prescription and supervision. They maintain daily records and regularly check the treatment machines to make sure they are working properly. Radiation therapists go through a two- to four-year educational program following high school or college. They take a special examination and must be certified by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists. In addition, many states require that radiation therapists be licensed."
Who is the dosimetrist,"Dosimetrists use treatment planning software to help the radiation oncologist develop a treatment plan for a patient. Contours are created for normal tissues, such as the lungs or liver and for tumor structures and other areas at risk for harboring cancer cells. They then calculate the dose of radiation that will be delivered to these contoured structures to make sure that the tumor gets enough radiation to destroy it while spares the normal tissues. There are generally accepted guidelines (dose constraints) for the amount of radiation that a particular organ can tolerate. Many of these treatment plans are very complex. Dosimetrists work with the radiation oncologist and the medical physicist to create the treatment plan that is best suited to each patient. Final decisions regarding the treatment plan are made by the radiation oncologist. Many dosimetrists start as radiation therapists and with intensive training, become medical dosimetrists. Others are graduates of one- to two-year dosimetry programs. The Medical Dosimetrist Certification Board certifies dosimetrists."
What role does a Radiation Oncology Nurse have in the medical team?,"Nurses work with the radiation team to care for patients during the course of treatment. They help evaluate the patient before treatment begins. They may talk to the patient about potential side effects and their management. During the course of radiation treatments, the nurse may evaluate the patient weekly or more frequently to assess problems and concerns. Nurses play a key role in educating the patient about treatment, side effects, etc. Radiation oncology nurses are registered nurses licensed to practice professional nursing. Most nurses in radiation therapy have additional accreditation in the specialty of oncology nursing. Advanced practice nurses in oncology, which include clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, have completed a master's degree program."
What role does a Social Worker play in the field of radiation therapy?,Social workers may be available to provide practical help and counseling to patients or members of their families. They can help a patient and their family members cope with the stressors associated with a cancer diagnosis. They also may help arrange for home health care and other services. Social workers may be licensed. Licensed social workers must have a master's degree and pass an examination.
What role does a dietitian play in the field of radiation therapy?,"Dietitians work with patients to help maintain nutrition. They monitor the patient's weight and identify any nutritional problems. Dietitians educate patients and may provide them with recipes and nutritional supplements to improve their nutritional status before, during and after treatment. Dietitians attend four years of college then usually take part in a one-year internship. The American Dietetic Association registers dietitians who have passed a professional examination."
What is colorectal cancer?,"Colorectal cancer is also known as large bowel cancer. Both terms describe malignant tumors found in the colon and rectum. The colon and rectum are part of the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, the colon is the upper 5 or 6 feet of the large intestine. The rectum is the lower 5 to 7 inches located above the anal canal.
 In the United States, colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death. However, the number of deaths from the disease continues to fall thanks to improved tests that detect cancer early, when it is most easily treated. Physical activity and a good diet can lower your risk for colorectal cancer."
What are the treatment options for colorectal cancer?,"Treatment options overview
 Treatment options depend on the stage of the colon cancer—that is, how far it has spread. The stage also depends on how deeply cancer is affecting the intestinal wall and other tissues and whether it is in the colon or rectum. In general, colon cancer patients receive post-operative chemotherapy if the lymph nodes are positive. Rectal cancer patients with positive nodes or tumors that extend into the fat surrounding the rectum receive chemotherapy plus radiation before surgery. Your doctor will tailor your treatment according to your age, medical history, overall health, and tolerance for specific medications and therapies.
 Standard options include: 
 
 Partial colectomy (partial bowel resection)—The surgeon removes the tumor and normal tissue on either side of the diseased area in the colon and reconnects the healthy colon. Sometimes the surgeon may have to create a temporary colostomy until the healthy tissue has healed. The colostomy creates an opening for solid waste from the bowel. The patient wears a special bag outside the body which collects the waste for disposal. At times, the colostomy may be permanent.
 Laparoscopic surgery or “keyhole” surgery—The surgeon inserts small, tube-like instruments and a camera into the abdomen through incisions in the abdominal wall. The surgeon sees what the camera sees on a video monitor. They may remove a large section of the bowel and adjacent tissue, called the mesentery.
 Radiation therapy
  —
  High-energy radiation kills cancer cells. Your doctor may use radiation in combination with surgery as
  definitive therapy. Or, they may use it to reduce
  (palliate) cancer symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or blockage. Selected rectal cancer patients may receive radiation therapy prior to surgery to improve outcomes. Typically, your doctor may use one of the following radiation therapies:
 
 
 External beam therapy (EBT): EBT delivers a beam of high-energy x-rays or protons to the tumor. A machine generates and targets the radiation beam at the tumor site. EBT destroys cancer cells, and conformal treatment plans spare surrounding normal tissues from exposure. 
 Brachytherapy: the temporary placement of radioactive source(s) within the body to give an extra dose—or boost—of radiation to the area of the excision site or to any residual tumor.
 Doctors use brachytherapy on rare occasions.
 Chemotherapy
  —
  Drugs are given through an IV or by mouth to kill cancer cells. Low doses of chemotherapy are often given at the same time as radiation therapy in order to help the radiation work better. Some patients may need higher doses of one or more chemotherapy drugs either before or after surgery to decrease the chance of the tumor returning elsewhere in the body. Like radiation therapy, chemotherapy can also ease disease symptoms and increase length of survival for patients with
  metastatic
  or incurable tumors. It is usually given over time and alternated with periods of no treatment. This helps ease potential side effects, such as abnormal blood-cell counts, fatigue, diarrhea, mouth sores, and a compromised or weakened immune system."
How to choose treatment for colorectal cancer?,"The team of doctors responsible for your care will provide you with information specific to your care. Your doctors will recommend the appropriate type(s) of treatment for you and will discuss these options with you. Generally, patients undergo a specific therapy because a cancer specialist has recommended it as the best way to treat the cancer."
What happens during radiation therapy for colorectal cancer,"Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays (photons) or a stream of particles. At high doses—much higher than x-ray exams use—it can destroy abnormal cells that cause cancer. It does this by damaging the cell's DNA, which eventually causes the cell to die.
 Because of the importance of treating the cancer but sparing healthy tissue, you will visit the medical center before actual therapy for treatment planning and simulation. The best patient positions for radiation exposure are determined for accurate, effective therapeutic results. The doctor may mark your skin with permanent ink. They may create customized lead shields to protect healthy organs or shape the radiation fields for your situation using special blocks inside the radiation machine. CT or MRI scans may help better visualize the tumor and the sensitive normal tissues and aid in treatment planning."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for colorectal cancer?,"Side effects that develop during treatment vary from person to person. However, some side effects are typical. 
 There are usually no immediate side effects from each radiation treatment. Most patients gradually develop mild fatigue over the course of therapy. This slowly goes away one to two months following treatment. Some patients develop some redness, dryness, and itching of the skin after a few weeks. Other patients develop substantial irritation.
 Skin reactions usually heal completely within a few weeks of completing treatment.
 Diarrhea, frequent bowel movements, or appetite loss is likely to occur at some point during the course of treatment. Generally, side effects stop gradually once treatment ceases, but bowel function may remain different from what it was before the disease started."
What kind of treatment follow-up for colorectal cancer?,"Colorectal cancer can recur, or reappear, in a patient previously treated for the disease. Because patients can sometimes be cured after their tumor recurs, follow-up care is critically important.
 
 Physical exam. Patients will undergo frequent physical exams from a few weeks to many years after treatment. This is especially true if treatment side effects do not go away or new symptoms develop. Pain, unexplained weight loss, or bleeding can occur with tumor recurrence.
 Blood tests. Follow-up evaluation usually includes blood tests. An abnormal result may indicate that the colorectal cancer is back.
 Colonoscopy. About one year after treatment, patients usually undergo colonoscopy to detect recurrence or development of new benign or malignant masses. If exam findings are normal, it should be repeated three years later, then every five years after that.
 Imaging. Also during follow-up exams, a patient may undergo
  computed tomography (CT) or
  magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI). CT and/or MRI can help determine treatment response and detect disease spread. Occasionally, your doctor may use
  positron emission tomography (PET) to detect disease spread. However, they will normally only use PET when other symptoms are present.."
Are there any new developments in treating colorectal cancer?,"Doctors are developing new drugs that enhance the tumor-killing ability of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. These drugs can work in a variety of ways but often enhance the normal cell-killing processes within the body. 
 Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy may allow for treatment with a reduced chance of long-term bowel complications. See the IMRT page and the Proton Therapy page for more information.
 Doctors are developing drugs to stop angiogenesis. This is the formation of new blood vessels that nourish the cancerous tumor. These drugs can shrink tumors or prevent disease from spreading.
 Immunotherapy enhances the body's immune system and increases the likelihood that the cancer cells will be killed.
 Monoclonal
  antibodies are manmade proteins that can identify a cancer cell for destruction or prevent the tumor cell from dividing. 
 Doctors are developing vaccines that may cause the body to produce more antibodies to kill cancer cells.
 Gene therapy involves altering genetic material. Doctors either introduce a new gene to enhance the body’s ability to kill cancer cells or administer a gene directly to the cancer cells, causing them to die. Getting the gene to the right cells in the body is a major challenge. The treatment is still experimental and in its early stages of development.
 
 Clinical Trials

What is prostate cancer?,"Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in American men. It is most prevalent in men over age 65 and common in men 50-64 years old. However, prostate cancer can occur in men younger than 50. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has dramatically improved the diagnosis of prostate cancer. As a result, men below the age of 65 years show an increased incidence of this disease."
What are treatment options for prostate cancer?,"Treatment options overview
 There are many treatment options for cancer limited to the prostate gland. You and your doctor should carefully consider each option. Weigh the benefits and risk as they relate to the aggressiveness and/or stage of the cancer as well as your age, overall health, and personal preferences. Standard treatments include:
 
 Surgery (radical prostatectomy): The surgeon makes an incision in the lower abdomen or through the perineum (between the anus and the scrotum) and removes the prostate. If they cannot remove the entire tumor, you may need radiation therapy. You will need to keep a urinary catheter in place for several weeks after the procedure. Possible side effects can include incontinence and impotence. Some surgeons may use three small incisions to do a robot-assisted prostatectomy. This may result in a shorter hospital stay and quicker recovery. This procedure may be preferable for some patients, but not for all.
 External beam therapy (EBT): EBT delivers a beam of high-energy x-rays or protons to the tumor. A machine generates and targets the radiation beam at the tumor site. EBT destroys cancer cells, and conformal treatment plans spare surrounding normal tissues from exposure. 
 Active surveillance: No treatment, with careful observation and medical monitoring.
 
 Advanced treatment options may avoid or minimize some of the side effects associated with standard therapies. These options include:
 
 Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: The surgeon removes the prostate without severing the critical nerves that enable sexual function. A skilled, experienced surgeon may be able to preserve sexual function for some patients using this procedure.
 Intensity modulated external beam radiation therapy (IMRT): External beam radiation therapy uses high energy radiation beams to kill cancer cells. IMRT uses advanced technology to target radiation to body structures. The doctor uses computerized three-dimensional images of the prostate, bladder, and rectum to shape and conform the radiation to the tumor. They may also target nearby lymph nodes. In this way, less radiation reaches the surrounding normal tissues. 3-D conformal radiation therapy and IMRT both deliver a higher radiation dose to the tumor while protecting healthy nearby organs. Doctors consider IMRT to be more highly focused. They typically provide IMRT daily (Monday through Friday) for four to nine weeks. IMRT is typically used with daily image guidance to help decrease the margin of normal tissue. For more detailed information see the IMRT page.
 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) uses photon or x-ray therapy at a much larger dose per treatment. SBRT treats prostate cancer over one to two weeks with four to five treatments. It requires higher precision and requires special equipment. Not all patients are candidates for SBRT.
 Proton beam therapy: Protons are atoms that carry a positive charge. Doctors use protons and x-rays (photons) to treat both benign and malignant tumors. There is no significant difference in the biological effects of protons versus photons. However, protons deliver radiation to the tumor in a much more confined way than photons. After they enter the body, protons release most of their energy within the tumor region. Unlike photons, they deliver only a minimal dose beyond the tumor boundaries. This allows the doctor to conform the radiation much tighter to the tumor. This may cause less damage to healthy tissue. Proton therapy allows the doctor to potentially give an even greater dose to the tumor while minimizing unwanted side effects. This is especially important when treating children because protons help reduce radiation to growing and developing tissues. Proton therapy costs more than other radiation treatments and is not widely available in the U.S. Doctors are currently investigating the use of proton therapy in various cancers. 
 Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT): 3-D conformal, IMRT, SBRT and proton therapy use daily image guidance to improve treatment setup. This is necessary because of organ movement and uncertainties in set-up. Depending on how full your bladder and rectum are, the prostate position can vary. So, the doctor must locate and verify the prostate’s position before each treatment. Various technologies are used to verify the position of the prostate. The type of IGRT you receive will depend on your case and what technology is available at your treatment center.
  
 If digital x-rays are taken on the linear accelerator, fiducial markers are placed in the prostate gland before the simulation. The digital x-ray images locate the metallic markers. This allows them to check the position of the prostate daily just before the treatment. They will make appropriate adjustments and align the prostate within the planned high-dose radiation treatment field. 
 Another method uses ultrasound to locate the prostate before each treatment. The patient keeps his bladder as full as possible to produce a good ultrasound image. This also moves the bladder out of the radiation treatment field. 
 Other methods use computed tomography (CT) and/or MRI scanning before each treatment to verify prostate position. 
 
 
 Cryotherapy: This procedure uses extremely low temperatures (-190°C) to freeze and destroy cancer cells. Some patients get good results and have few complications with cryotherapy. Others do not. Cryotherapy is an alternative to surgery for patients whose prostate cancer has returned after radiation treatment. It is not typically used in the primary treatment of prostate cancer.
 Brachytherapy: Brachytherapy may be temporary or permanent. Talk to your radiation oncologist about the specifics of your treatment.
  
 Temporary brachytherapy places radioactive material inside a catheter for a specific amount of time and then removes it. It is given at a low-dose rate (LDR) or high-dose rate (HDR).
 Permanent brachytherapy is also called seed implantation. It permanently places radioactive seeds (about the size of a grain of rice) in or near the tumor. After several months, the seeds lose their radioactivity. Sometimes, active seeds may trigger radiation detectors at security checkpoints. You may need a doctor's note to explain your situation to security personnel. Inactive seeds are harmless and rarely trigger metal detectors.
 
 
 Radium 223 treatment: Xofigo (pronounced zoh-fee-go) is a brand name for Radium 223. Doctors use this isotope to treat prostate cancers that have spread to the bones. Bone cells absorb radium because it chemically resembles calcium. Cancer cells are more active than normal bone cells, so they are more likely to absorb the isotope. The isotope releases radiation within a very small area. It kills the nearby cancer cells while sparing the surrounding, healthy bone cells. Radium 223 effectively controls advanced prostate cancer and reduces pain in more than one area because it travels throughout the body. The injection takes up to a minute. The doctor will typically repeat injection every four weeks for up to six or more total treatments. This is an outpatient procedure, so you may return home afterwards. Treatment side effects include diarrhea, anemia, and pain around the tumor. Radium treatment may cause sperm damage. Therefore, men who receive it shouldn't father children for at least six months. 
 
 How can I choose from among the options?
 
  
 If I choose surgery, will radiation treatment still be required?
 Your surgery may be incomplete (meaning some cancer remains) or show a more advanced cancer. If the surgeon has inadvertently cut through tumor, you have what is called a positive margin. Having a positive margin or disease that breaks through the capsule of the prostate gland or invades the seminal vesicles (T3) are reasons to meet with a radiation oncologist soon after you recover from surgery. Additional radiation therapy within three to six months may prevent the cancer from coming back. Discuss this option with your treatment team.
 If I choose radiation therapy, will surgical treatment still be an option?
 Your doctor may use radiation therapy as your primary treatment. It is important to note that the cure rates for surgery and radiation are similar. Therefore, you have the same risk of cancer recurring if surgery is performed. 
 If it is not successful, your doctor will likely not consider surgery or repeat radiation therapy due to the risk of serious complications. If your doctor recommends surgery after radiation or additional radiation, the doctor performing the re-treatment or surgery should have a significant level of experience. There are experimental clinical studies being evaluated for use of very localized re-irradiation (brachytherapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy) for this group of patients. Some patients for whom radiation is not effective are treated with systemic therapy or closely monitored. Additional treatment will depend on the PSA level and rate of rise of the PSA.
 How effective is modern radiation treatment of prostate cancer?
 Thanks to improvements in technology and daily imaging, radiation therapy can deliver a higher radiation dose directly to the tumor while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Doctors use different imaging techniques to see the prostate and surrounding tissues in three dimensions. This allows the doctor to tailor the radiation more precisely to the individual patient's unique needs. Treatment planning allows them to estimate and minimize radiation exposure to the rectum, small bowel, bladder, and hips. This helps reduce the risk of side effects and complications. The goal is to safely provide a high dose of radiation, which improves the chance of cure. For similar stage and prostate cancer types, radiation therapy is as effective as surgery."
How to choose treatment for prostate cancer?,"In addition to talking with family and friends, you will need a team of physicians to help advise you. You should meet with everyone involved in your treatment planning before choosing a treatment, including:
 your primary care doctor
 a urologist to discuss surgery
 a radiation oncologist to discuss radiation therapy
 a medical oncologist to discuss hormone suppression, if your cancer is more advanced
 After you meet with these doctors, you can make an informed decision regarding your treatment options. You may have an early-stage or moderately advanced cancer with no evidence of spread to other organs (non-metastatic). If so, your two major treatment options are active surveillance (for the earliest, least aggressive cancers), surgery (by your urologist) or radiation therapy (by a radiation oncologist).
 You may have advanced cancer and require hormonal suppression therapy or chemotherapy. If so, you will need a medical oncologist to administer these drugs. Doctors use hormone-ablation therapy to treat advanced prostate cancer. It suppresses androgen (or testosterone) because these hormones stimulate most prostate cancer growth. Your internist, urologist, radiation oncologist or medical oncologist may administer the treatment. Depending on the stage of the cancer, your doctor may use hormone suppression therapy and radiation therapy to help control your disease. You may receive hormone suppression therapy for as little as four to six months, or for as long as two to three years."

The goal is to safely provide a high dose of radiation, which improves the chance of cure. For similar stage and prostate cancer types, radiation therapy is as effective as surgery."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for prostate cancer?,"Initially, most patients do not have side effects. Radiation side effects build with time. They tend to be worse toward the end of a week and better after the weekend break. As radiation treatment goes on, it may cause you to feel tired. While adequate rest is important, doctors will usually advise you to stay as active as you can. You may have some rectal irritation such as bowel urgency, discomfort, diarrhea, and/or frequent and uncomfortable urination. Also, skin in the treated area may become dry. Redness, tenderness, or hair loss is unusual. 
 Radiation therapy can cause impotence in some men at a similar rate as nerve-sparing prostatectomy. Typically, radiation induced impotence will respond to medications to improve erectile function. There is also a small risk of late bladder or rectal problems with radiation. These may appear one to three years after radiation therapy. Your radiation oncologist will monitor you for late complications and check your PSA in your follow-up appointments."
What kind of treatment follow-up for prostate cancer?,"Patients usually return to see the radiation oncologist about two to eight weeks after the last radiation therapy session. The main purpose of this visit is to see if the side effects from treatment—such as bowel or urinary symptoms—have subsided. In most patients, these symptoms subside in a few weeks. The doctor will check up on you and make sure you make good progress in recovery. After that, you will have regular follow-ups every three to six months. Your doctor may use a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. A blood test will measure your PSA level and assess your response to treatment. Higher PSA levels can indicate the presence of prostate cancer. During follow-up, your doctor can also monitor any late treatment side effects and help manage them.
 You may ask the radiation oncologist, “How am I doing? Is the cancer all gone? Am I cured?” However, they cannot answer these questions immediately. After radiation therapy, it may take months to see your full treatment response. The body gradually disposes of dead cancer cells. Some cancer cells, even if technically dead (they cannot multiply), may continue to function for a while before ultimately dying. The rate of PSA level drop for successful radiation therapy is much slower than that of surgery. PSA usually drops by half every three to four months after radiation, and typically to the lowest level in about 12 to 18 months."
Are there any new developments in treating prostate cancer?,"Doctors often successfully treat prostate cancer. Sometimes, however, the disease returns (recurs). An FDA-approved radiotracer for PET/CT called Axumin® (fluciclovine F-18) helps detect and locate cancer that recurs following radiation therapy or surgery. 
 Conventional imaging, such as MRI or ultrasound, cannot locate recurring prostate cancer when it is small. PET/CT with Axumin® can detect recurring cancer when PSA levels are low and when the cancer is small. 
 Identifying the exact location and extent of the disease at an early stage is vital. It allows doctors to specifically target the cancer and limit exposure to healthy tissues. 
 Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a protein that helps develop prostate cancer. A PSMA scan uses PET imaging and a radiotracer to locate recurrent cancer. Lutetium-177 PSMA therapy is recently shown to improve survival in certain metastatic prostate cancer patients.

What is Esophageal Cancer?,"Esophageal cancer develops in the lining of the esophagus. This long, tube-like structure connects the throat and the stomach. As a part of the upper digestive system, it carries swallowed food to the stomach. The wall of the esophagus consists of several layers of tissue.
 There are two main types of esophageal cancer:
 
 squamous cell carcinoma – cancer that develops in the thin, flat squamous cells.
 adenocarcinoma – cancer that develops in glandular cells.
 
 Early-stage esophageal cancer may have no symptoms. Advanced cancer symptoms may include:
 
 difficulty or pain when swallowing
 weight loss
 pain with swallowing or in the chest
 coughing and regurgitation
 hoarseness
 vomiting blood
 tarry, black stool or blood in stool
 indigestion and heartburn"
What are the treatment options for esophageal cancer?,"Treatment options include:
 
 Surgery
 Your doctor may use surgery alone for early-stage disease or with other therapies for advanced disease. Sometimes, the tumor is small and does not go beyond the first layer of the lining in the esophagus. If so, the surgeon may remove the tumor and a small amount of surrounding healthy tissue (called a margin).
 For more advanced cancer, your doctor may remove part of the esophagus. An esophagectomy removes the cancerous portion of the esophagus and nearby lymph nodes. The surgeon reconnects the remaining esophagus to the stomach or part of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. An esophagogastrectomy removes the cancerous part of the esophagus, nearby lymph nodes and part of the stomach.
 Endoscopic Treatments
 Endoscopic treatments treat early and pre-cancers and can provide pain relief (palliative treatment). These include:
 
 Endoscopic mucosal resection: This procedure inserts a thin tube called an endoscope through the throat to the esophagus. The device has a light, video camera and surgical tools to remove cancerous tissue.
 
 Chemotherapy
  This treatment stops cancer cells from dividing and kills them. Your doctor may use it before or after surgery. Chemotherapy also helps relieve symptoms when cancer has spread (metastasized).
 Monoclonal Antibody Therapy (also called targeted therapy)
 A small number of esophageal cancers have too much HER2 protein on the surface of their cells. The monoclonal antibody attaches to the HER2 protein and interferes with the cancer cells’ ability to grow. Your doctor may use antibody therapy with chemotherapy.
 Immunotherapy
 This treatment helps activate the body’s own immune system to better identify and kill cancer cells. Your doctor may use it after surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence or to limit the progression of the cancer when it has spread. 
 Radiation therapy
 This treatment uses radiation to kill cancer cells.
 
 Esophageal cancer patients may receive external beam therapy (EBT). EBT uses a machine to generate beams of high-energy radiation and direct them at the tumor. Doctors use photons (x-rays and gamma rays) and protons (proton therapy) to treat cancer.
 
 
 Your treatment plan may combine therapies. Patients who are not candidates for surgery receive radiation and chemotherapy. Surgical patients may receive radiation before surgery to help shrink the tumor (neoadjuvant treatment). Or, they may receive it after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells (adjuvant therapy). Radiation may also help manage symptoms and complications of advanced disease. These may include tumor growth that prevents food reaching the stomach, tumor bleeding, and pain."
What happens during radiation therapy for esophageal cancer?,"Before starting radiation therapy, patients who cannot swallow may have a tube inserted into their esophagus. This tube (esophageal stent) allows the esophagus to remain open.
 EBT begins with simulation and treatment planning. Simulation will determine your position on the treatment table. The treatment team will make devices to help you maintain that position. They may make body molds, head masks, or other devices to help you stay still during treatment. The team may also apply temporary skin marks or tattoos to help precisely position you for each treatment session.
 Your doctor will use computed tomography (CT), position emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to map the location of the cancer and healthy tissues nearby. Using these images and treatment planning tools, the team – dosimetrist, radiation physicist and radiation oncologist – will create a treatment plan. The plan guides the team in delivering the right amount of radiation to the tumor while minimizing exposure to surrounding normal tissues.
 After simulation and planning, treatment can begin.
 EBT often uses high energy x-rays from a machine called a linear accelerator. Different EBT techniques include three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT).
 
 3D-CRT focuses the radiation beams on the tumor with greater precision. This allows safe delivery of a high radiation dose. 
 IMRT uses special devices called collimators to regulate the intensity of the radiation beams. This allows the doctor to deliver different radiation doses to different areas of the tumor and nearby tissues.
 Using IGRT with IMRT helps ensure precise delivery of radiation to the same location with each dose.
 
 You may need to change into a gown before each treatment. You will lie on the treatment couch in the same position as the simulation using the immobilization devices. The therapist leaves the room and turns on the linear accelerator from outside.
 You will have a series of outpatient treatment sessions over several weeks. Your diagnosis will determine how long treatment will take. Each session lasts less than an hour. Getting into the correct position on the treatment table occupies most of this time."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for esophageal cancer?,"Radiation treatment can cause side effects. These problems may result from the treatment itself or from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area.
 The type of radiation, dose, and body part under treatment will all affect the number and severity of side effects. Talk to your doctor and/or nurse so they can help manage them.
 Radiation may cause early or acute side effects during treatment. You may also have chronic or late side effects months or years after treatment. These side effects vary and may depend on your general health and the body area under treatment. They may also depend on daily radiation dose, total treatment dose, and other treatments (such as chemotherapy) you may have at the same time.
 EBT patients typically have difficulty swallowing and pain soon after starting treatment. This is because the radiation is killing the cells in the lining of the esophagus. It causes a reaction like a sunburn. Make sure you drink plenty of water and maintain good nutrition during this time. If you do not, your doctor may insert a feeding tube before or during treatment until you can swallow again. After treatment is complete, the pain usually subsides within a few weeks.
 Other common side effects include:
 
 fatigue
 skin changes, including dryness, itching, peeling, and blistering
 diarrhea
 dry mouth and other mouth problems
 fatigue
 nausea (especially if the abdomen is treated)
 inflammation from radiation to the chest, which may lead to difficulty swallowing, cough, or feeling short of breath 
 pain with or difficulty swallowing
 lower blood counts, which can lead to increased fatigue and risk of infection and bruising
 loss of hair in the treatment area
 
 Most of these side effects go away within two months after treatment.
 You may have late or long-term side effects six or more months after treatment. This depends on the body area under treatment, the treatment itself, and individual risk factors. Radiation therapy may cause a stricture (narrowing) in the esophagus. This may require further treatment. Other possible long-term side effects include:
 
 fibrosis (scar tissue replaces normal tissue and restricts movement of the affected area)
 damage to the bowels, causing diarrhea and bleeding
 heart or lung damage from radiation to the chest, leading to possible problems breathing and shortness of breath
 thyroid problems or irritation of the esophagus from radiation to the neck
 developing another (secondary) cancer later in life.
 
 There is a very rare risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. After treatment, your radiation oncologist will regularly check you for complications and recurrent or new cancers.
 Talk to your doctor before and during treatment about what side effects to expect and ways you can minimize them."
Are there any new developments in treating esophageal cancer?,"New imaging methods, such as endoscopic ultrasound, PET-CT, and probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, are improving esophageal cancer detection. Endomicroscopy provides real-time microscopic views of the esophagus.
 Advances in surgical resection techniques for esophageal cancer offer improved outcomes. Minimally invasive techniques, such as endoscopic mucosal resection, are improving survival rates."
Who will be involved in a Proton therapy?,"As with other forms of external beam therapy, proton beam therapy requires a treatment team, including a radiation oncologist, radiation physicist, dosimetrist, radiation therapist, and nurse. The radiation oncologist is a specially trained physician who evaluates the patient and determines the appropriate therapy, specific area for treatment, and radiation dose. Working together, the radiation oncologist, radiation physicist, dosimetrist and radiation therapist establish the best way to deliver the prescribed dose. Imaging exams are critical in delivering this treatment, and a diagnostic radiologist plays an important role as well. The radiation physicist and the dosimetrist make detailed treatment calculations to ensure treatment will be accurately delivered. Radiation therapists are specially trained technologists who perform the daily radiation treatments. Radiation therapy nurses are team members who tend to your day-to-day concerns and help to manage the side effects of the treatment."
What equipment is used in proton therapy?,"Proton beam therapy uses special machines, a cyclotron and synchrotron being the most common, to generate and accelerate protons to speeds up to 60 percent the speed of light and energies of up to 250 million electron volts. These high-energy protons are steered by magnets toward the treatment room, and then to the specific part of the body being treated. In some older proton machines, additional pieces of equipment are needed to modify the range of the protons and the shape of the beam. Newer facilities make similar adjustments by fine tuning the energy of the beam and the magnetic fields which guide their path (""pencil beam scanning"" or ""scanning beam""). These modifications guide the proton beam to precise locations in the body where they deliver the energy needed to destroy tumor cells."
Who works at a proton therapy center?,"With backgrounds in mechanical, electrical, software, hardware and controls, specialized operators maintain, upgrade and repair the accelerators (i.e., cyclotrons and synchrotrons) and radiation delivery system. As with other forms of external beam radiation therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), specially trained radiation therapists will be present in the treatment rooms to help patients get set up for treatment, deliver the treatment, and monitor patients closely to ensure safety and comfort during the procedure. See the IMRT page for more information."
What should I do before a Proton Therapy treatment?,"Several preparation steps are needed before a patient begins proton therapy. The first step in treatment preparation is a procedure referred to as ""simulation,"" in which the patient is fitted into one of any number of specialized immobilization devices to ensure an exact, highly reproducible position for each treatment. Sometimes, there is a need for placement of a metallic marker (fiducial marker) in or around the tumor to help guide the treatment. If necessary, these procedures are usually performed a few days before the simulation.
 The patient immobilization device used depends upon the location of the tumor. For treatments above the neck, a custom mask can be placed around the face, or custom tray that can be temporarily attached to the teeth. For treatments below the neck, custom molds of various shapes can be positioned under or around the body. Once the immobilization device is constructed, patients undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan, which is used to create a virtual, 3-D reconstruction of the tumor and normal tissues around it. Radiation oncologists define the boundaries of the tumor and the surrounding normal structures within this virtual computerized 3-D model, and work with physicists to determine the safest and most effective radiation techniques. This CT scan is performed in exactly the same position as for treatment, so the radiation oncologist can be sure the high-precision plan designed in the computer will accurately target the tumor.
 Additional exams, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a PET/CT scan are often needed to help the physician accurately determine the location and extent of the tumor or critical structures."
How is a proton therapy performed?,"Proton beam therapy is typically performed on an outpatient basis. For most tumor sites, a standard course of treatment is two to eight weeks, with treatments delivered five days per week. The length of each treatment will vary depending upon the tumor type and stage. The delivery of the proton beam to the patient lasts only a few minutes, although the total time spent in the treatment room will be longer (about 15 to 30 minutes) for positioning and adjustments to the equipment settings.
 For daily treatments, the patient enters the treatment room and is fitted with his or her personal immobilization device. The patient is positioned with the aid of laser lights to within a few millimeters of the needed position, which by comparison with images obtained at the time of simulation to ensure the patient is properly aligned. In some cases, a CT system will be used to image the target before each treatment. This special alignment and imaging process is repeated before each treatment to assure the highest precision. 
 If special apertures and filters are needed for treatment, they are placed into position at some point during this process. A computer is typically used to scan and verify that the correct device has been loaded. Once positioning and treatment parameters are verified, the radiation oncologist and technologists step out into a control room located next to the treatment room and begin the treatment. During the treatment, these therapists continually monitor the progress of radiation delivery, including several safety parameters. Therapists also watch and listen to the patient closely, using video cameras, to ensure they remain safe and comfortable during the treatment. Once the prescribed radiation dose has been delivered, the computer shuts off the proton beam and the technologists re-enter the room to assist the patient in removing the mask or immobilization device."
What will I feel during and after the procedure?,"You should not feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. Afterward, there may be some side effects, and they will be managed by your radiation oncologist in the same way they would be for any course of radiation. Other factors that may influence how well you feel after treatment are how big a dose you are given and whether you are also getting chemotherapy at the same time. Common side effects include temporary hair loss and skin reactions in the direct path of the radiation and fatigue, especially when a large area is being treated.
 Radiation treatment can cause side effects. These problems may result from the treatment itself or from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area.
 The number and severity of side effects will depend on the type of radiation, dose, and body part under treatment. Talk to your doctor and/or nurse so they can help manage them.
 Radiation can cause early and late side effects. Early side effects happen during or right after treatment. They are typically gone within a few weeks. Common early side effects include fatigue and skin problems. Skin in the treatment area may become sensitive, red, irritated, or swollen. Other changes include dryness, itching, peeling, and blistering.
 Depending on the area being treated, other early side effects may include:
 
 hair loss in the treatment area
 mouth problems and difficulty swallowing
 eating and digestion problems
 diarrhea
 nausea and vomiting
 headaches
 soreness and swelling in the treatment area
 urinary and bladder changes
 
 Late side effects may occur months or years following treatment. While they are often permanent, they are rare. They include:
 
 brain changes
 spinal cord changes
 lung changes
 kidney changes
 colon and rectal changes
 infertility
 joint changes
 lymphedema
 mouth changes
 secondary cancer
 
 There is a slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. After treatment, your radiation oncologist will regularly check for complications and recurrent or new cancers.
 The slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy is lower for proton than conventional x-ray (photon) treatment. 
 Highly advanced techniques such as proton therapy allow radiation oncologists to maximize the cancer-destroying capabilities of radiation, while minimizing its side effects."
Who will be involved in external beam therapy?,"EBT delivery requires a treatment team, including a radiation oncologist, medical physicist, dosimetrist, and radiation therapist. The radiation oncologist evaluates the patient and decides on the appropriate therapy. They will determine which areas require treatment and the total dose they will deliver. Working closely with the medical physicist and the dosimetrist, the radiation oncologist determines which technique is optimal to deliver the prescribed dose. The physicist and the dosimetrist will then make detailed treatment calculations and quality assurance checks to ensure that the planned radiation will be administered accurately and safely prior to treating the patient. Radiation therapists will also get involved when you get your radiation. These are specially trained technologists who assist in setup and delivery of the daily treatments."
What equipment is used for external beam therapy?,"Radiation oncologists use linear accelerators or cobalt machines to deliver EBT. Your radiation oncologist will determine the equipment best suited to your treatment. EBT most commonly uses a linear accelerator. A radiation therapist will operate the equipment. The radiation oncologist, a highly trained doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy, will create and oversee the overall treatment plan."
Is there any special preparation needed for external beam therapy?,"EBT involves:
 
 simulation
 treatment planning 
 treatment delivery
 
 Simulation is a session dedicated to determining the position you will need to be in for the treatments. This visit is scheduled prior to starting radiation. Depending on which area of the body will receive radiation, there are various devices (masks, pads) which can help to immobilize your body so that there is very minimal motion. This ensures that the radiation will be delivered safely and accurately on a day-to-day basis. Once the optimal position is determined, the therapists may make small markings on your skin to help them reproduce your treatment position. These marks may be tattoos or colored ink. The tattoos will be permanent, but the colored ink will eventually fade. The doctor may also place marker seeds in the target tumor or organ during a separate procedure. These seeds or markings help the radiation therapist correctly position you for each treatment session. Photos of the positioning will be taken for reference. You will then have a computed tomography (CT) scan done in this setup. The CT is for the radiation oncologist to use for radiation planning purposes.
 For treatment planning, the dosimetrist, medical physicist, and radiation oncologist work together and use a special computer program to create your plan. The radiation oncologist will determine the volume of the tumor and other treatment areas and outline them on the CT images acquired during simulation. They will also outline normal organs or nearby structures so they can calculate the radiation dose they will deliver to your tumor and the surrounding normal tissue. As a team, the oncologist, dosimetrist, and physicist will select the most optimal plan which delivers the appropriate dose to the tumor while sparing surrounding normal tissues. In certain cases, this process may employ techniques such as three-dimensional conformal therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). This planning is based on CT, MRI, and PET/CT scans.
 Once simulation and planning are complete, treatment can begin."
"How is external beam therapy delivered, or administered to patients?","Before each treatment session, you may need to change into a gown, depending on which area of the body is to be treated. The radiation therapist will assist you onto the linear accelerator’s treatment bed. The therapist will use the same immobilization devices to replicate the position you were in for your simulation. They will use the alignment lasers and any marks placed on you during simulation to assist with this process. The accuracy of your position will be verified with imaging prior to the treatment delivery. This may include x-rays, ultrasound, or cone beam CT. The therapist goes outside the room and turns on the linear accelerator from outside. 
 The treatment process can take one hour or less each day. Most of this time is spent positioning and imaging the patient to ensure accuracy. The first treatment usually takes the longest as the radiation oncologist compares the position and imaging with the simulation and approves it. Subsequent treatments take between 15 and 30 minutes. The actual time in which the linear accelerator is delivering the radiation may last only several minutes; however, the total treatment time depends on the method of delivery, such as IMRT, the size of the area being treated, and the dose given. Treatment may use beams from one or more directions, and the beam may be on for as long as several minutes for each field. Each treatment will usually take the same amount of time.
 Patients usually receive radiation treatments once a day, five days a week for a total of two to nine weeks. Your diagnosis will determine how long you receive treatment. Occasionally, you may receive treatment twice a day or every other day."
What will I feel during external beam therapy?,"External beam therapy is painless; patients will hear buzzing or clicking noises during treatment, which is from the linear accelerator rotating or moving during treatment. Patients feel nothing out of the ordinary but may sometimes smell the ozone produced by the linear accelerator. Some patients may also see a colored light when they receive their treatment. This is especially true for patients who are receiving treatment for their brain or eyes."
What kind of treatment follow-up should I expect for external beam therapy?,"Once all treatments are complete, patients should continue to follow up with their radiation oncologist regularly. These visits will assess recovery from radiation side effects, tumor response to the treatment and surveillance with imaging/blood tests to ensure that the cancer has not come back. The doctor will explain how long the follow-ups will continue, based on the type of cancer and treatment given."
What is radiaiton therapy and who is involved?,"An increasing number of cancer patients have success with radiation therapy. The use of three-dimensional imaging, computerized treatment planning and high-energy x-rays make precise treatment possible. 
 Radiation therapy professionals include: 
 
 Radiation oncologists

 Click on any of the professionals above to learn more about that specialty."
How is radiation therapy used in cancer care?,"Your doctor may use
 external beam therapy (EBT) to treat you. EBT uses a
 linear accelerator to produce x-rays or gamma rays by accelerating electrons. Proton therapy is a form of EBT that uses cyclotrons or synchrotrons to produce charged atoms. Both methods can destroy tumors.
 
 Your doctor may use
 brachytherapy to treat you. This treatment places radioactive sources inside your body on a temporary or permanent basis. The doctor seals the radioactive sources in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters and implants them directly into or near a tumor. Brachytherapy is a common treatment for
 cancers of the prostate, uterus, cervix and
 breast.
 
 Radiation is the primary treatment for some patients. In other cases, radiation therapy and
 chemotherapy are delivered at the same time. This combined therapy can improve the effectiveness of treatment and reduce the chance that the cancer will return. Sometimes, the patient receives radiation therapy before (neoadjuvant treatment) or after (adjuvant treatment) surgery. Your doctor will work closely with other cancer specialists to determine the best path for your care."
What are the steps involved in radiation therapy?,"Planning will occur before your treatment begins. First, you will have a “simulation scan” on a special CT scanner. A simulation scan is a CT scan for radiation planning purposes. While you may have had a CT scan before, this scan is different and specific for radiation planning. The radiation therapy team will spend time placing you in a position that will be used during radiation treatment. This scan may use IV or oral contrast. If needed, the doctor will create a device (such as a mask) to help you keep still. 
 The radiation oncologist will outline the treatment area, tumor, areas at risk for cancer spread, and areas to avoid. Dosimetrists, medical physicists, and radiation oncologists will develop and check the radiation plan for quality and safety.
 A radiation therapist will deliver your radiation therapy. The remaining healthcare team members will help manage any side effects."
What are the different techniques used in radiation therapy?,"Radiation can also damage normal cells. Therefore, it is important to precisely target therapy to the cancer cells.
 Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) precisely focuses radiation on the tumor from many different angles and intensities. This allows for safer delivery of higher doses of radiation.
 Other ultra-precise techniques include 
 stereotactic radiosurgery. This treatment uses 3-D imaging to find the tumor’s exact coordinates. Highly focused gamma rays or x-rays then converge on the tumor to treat it. The Gamma Knife® uses radioactive cobalt sources to focus multiple beams of radiation on the tumor. Linear accelerators can deliver
 stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the brain and other parts of the body, including the prostate, lung, liver, and bone. 
 Your doctor may use image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) with IMRT to precisely deliver radiation to the tumor. IGRT uses a CT scan or x-ray to align the target in the correct location for radiation therapy. Imaging is done before your treatment to make sure you are in the correct position and the tumor will be treated effectively.
 In specialized cases such as cancer in the liver, your doctor may also use radiation delivered through your circulatory system. 
 Radioembolization uses microspheres filled with radioactive isotopes to deliver high doses of radiation to the target through the blood supply."
What medical condition is treated with the Gamma Knife?,"Gamma Knife® helps find and precisely treat small targets in the head and brain. The device can deliver an intense dose of radiation to the target area while sparing surrounding brain tissue. Your doctor may use it to treat: 
 
 malignant tumors that start in or spread to the brain 
 benign brain tumors 
 blood vessel defects and functional problems. 
 
 See the Brain Tumor, Brain Tumor Treatment, and Vascular Malformations pages for more information.
 Doctors are studying possible uses of Gamma Knife® for epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease."
How does the Gamma Knife work?,"Gamma Knife® uses Stereotactic Radiosurgery. This technique uses multiple beams of radiation converging in three dimensions to focus precisely on a target area. This allows your doctor to safely deliver an intense dose of radiation to that target. Many devices can move the patient in tiny increments during treatment to successfully focus radiation on all parts of the target.
 Treatments using the Perfexion Device 
 Most Perfexion treatments take just one session. Targets larger than three or four centimeters often require more than one session.
 Under local anesthesia, the doctor attaches a special rigid head frame to the patient's skull with four screws. The frame uses a three-dimensional coordinate system to help treatment planning. The doctor will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or angiography to obtain the necessary images. The images then go to the planning computer system. The treatment team will outline the target areas and normal anatomical structures. The computer will determine the exact spatial relationship between the target, normal structures, and the head frame. The team uses this information to calculate treatment parameters. Often, it is best to treat targets with combinations of several successive highly focused treatments (shots). The team fine-tunes the treatment parameters until they arrive at an optimal and conformal plan.
 Using the planning coordinates, the doctor attaches the frame to the Gamma Knife® unit. The team centers the target in about 200 precision-aimed, converging gamma radiation beams. Treatment takes from several minutes to a few hours depending on the target’s shape and size, number of shots, and prescribed dose. Patients do not feel the radiation during treatment, but they may see flashes of light. After treatment, the doctor removes the frame, and the patient returns to normal activity.
 Treatments using the Icon Device
 Icon treatments differ from Perfexion treatments in that: 
 
 Treatments take place in single or multiple sessions.
 The patient does not need an external frame.
 Icon uses a combination of onboard stereotactic Cone Beam CT imaging and real-time infrared motion detection and management. This allows Icon to achieve 0.15 mm treatment accuracy without a rigid frame. 
 
 See the Stereotactic Radiosurgery page for additional information."
Who operates the gamma knife?,"A team approach provides patients with the greatest safety. This team usually consists of a radiation oncologist, medical physicist, and neurosurgeon specially trained to use a Gamma Knife®. Sometimes, a radiologist or neuroradiologist may also contribute input. Nursing staff, anesthesiologists (for patients who are unable to cooperate, such as children), and radiation therapists support the team. Together, these professionals work to provide high-quality care. 
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires an “authorized user” (usually a radiation oncologist) to be at the treatment console during the entire procedure."
How does the gamma knife ensure patient safety?,"Accurate placement of the shots is critical to localizing the radiation within a fraction of a millimeter. Anything less is unacceptable. In fact, the following are all critical to accurate treatment:
 
 Rigidly and accurately attaching the head frame
 Accurate targeting of imaging exams
 Shaping the volume of the target area (shot size, number, and relative intensity) 
 
 Correct target selection and accurate calculation of the amount of radiation to deliver are essential to successful treatment. A qualified medical physicist assures that the imaging and treatment planning computers and software are correct and acceptable. The physicist routinely tests the machine to ensure the safety of patients and medical staff."
What is radiation therapy used for in terms of pain relief?,"Large tumors can press on nerves, bones, and organs and grow into tissue nearby, causing pain. Your physician may recommend palliative radiation therapy to treat these painful tumors.
 The team of professionals involved in palliative radiation therapy treatment includes:
 
 Radiation oncologists (physicians)
 Radiation therapists
 Radiation oncology nurses
 Medical physicists
 Dosimetrists
 Social workers
 Dietitians
 Palliative care physicians (can have training in medicine, medical oncology, radiation oncology, anesthesiology, or surgery)"
What is radiation therapy for pain relief?,"Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy radiation to treat cancer. Palliative radiation therapy uses the same radiation at a lower dose to alleviate the symptoms and pain caused by certain types of cancer.
 Radiation therapy directs high-energy radiation at cancer cells, damaging their DNA and disabling their ability to reproduce. The body naturally gets rid of the damaged cells. 
 Palliative radiation therapy shrinks tumors, easing the pressure on body parts nearby. Physicians use radiation therapy to:
 
 shrink tumors in the brain that create swelling and pressure inside the skull
 relieve pressure from tumors on airways, blood vessels, nerves, and other tubular structures in the body (like the intestines)
 stop cancers from bleeding. 
 
 Bone Pain
 Cancer in the bones weakens the bone, increasing fracture risk. The cancer can start in the bone or move to the bone from somewhere else. Palliative radiation shrinks cancer in the bone, relieving pressure and pain and slowly letting the bone heal itself. Radiation therapy does not “melt” bones. Radiation therapy directed at cancer in the bone can make walking and movement less painful and help healthy bone tissue to regrow.
 Spinal Cord
 Cancer in the spine can put pressure on the nerves of the spinal cord. This compression can cause pain, leg weakness, or loss of bladder or bowel control. Palliative radiation therapy helps prevent and treat these symptoms. Radiation can be delivered before or after spine surgery to treat spinal cord compression. Cancer can also grow inside the spinal canal around the spine itself. Radiation therapy can help treat this as well; surgery is rarely used in these cases."
How is radiation therapy used for pain relief?,"A radiation oncologist may use EBT or brachytherapy for pain relief. The planning and delivery of palliative radiation therapy is similar to the process used for treating cancer. One significant difference is the radiation dose, which is usually lower for palliative radiation therapy.
 For EBT, the radiation source is outside the patient's body. A radiation treatment machine can be a linear accelerator that accelerates electrons to produce x-rays or can have a radioactive piece of metal that aims gamma rays to specific parts of the body. 
 Brachytherapy places a radioactive source inside the body. Needles, seeds, wires, or catheters containing a radioactive source are implanted directly into or near a tumor. The radioactive source may remain inside the body temporarily or permanently. See the Radiation Therapy page for more information."
What are the steps involved in radiation therapy for pain relief?,"Palliative external beam radiation therapy begins with a planning session. You will first undergo a CT simulation scan; this CT scan is very similar to diagnostic CT scans you may have had before. The radiation therapist may place permanent or temporary marks on your skin to help position you for radiation treatments.
 If your head or neck are being treated, the radiation therapists may form a special mask around your head to keep your head very still for each treatment.
 The radiation plan is developed and checked by dosimetrists, medical physicists, and radiation oncologists. The plan also undergoes quality and safety checks. Specially trained radiation therapists deliver the treatment. 
 You may need one or several weeks of treatments to relieve your pain."
What are the common side effects of radiation therapy for pain relief?,"Your treatment team will explain the potential side effects of palliative radiation therapy. These side effects depend on the area of your body treated. Your doctor can prescribe pain and anti-nausea medications. Most side effects go away 4-6 weeks following treatment. Side effects can include:
 
 fatigue
 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
 pain while swallowing
 a temporary pain flare before pain starts to improve
 a little dry skin or redness in the treatment area"
What is head and neck cancer?,"The way a particular head and neck cancer behaves depends on the site in which it arises (the primary site). For example, cancers that begin in the vocal cords behave very differently than those that arise in the back of the tongue, which is only an inch or less from the vocal cords.
 The most common type of cancer in the head and neck is squamous cell carcinoma, which arises from the cells that line the inside of the nose, mouth and throat. Squamous cell cancer is often associated with a history of smoking or exposure to the human papilloma virus (HPV). Other less common types of head and neck cancers include salivary gland tumors, lymphomas, and sarcomas. Methods of prevention include avoiding exposure to alcohol and tobacco products as well as vaccinating children and young adults against HPV.
 Cancers spread in four main ways. The first is direct extension from the primary site to adjacent areas. The second is spread through the lymphatic channels to lymph nodes. The third is spread along nerves (perineural spread) to other areas of the head and neck. The fourth is spread through the blood vessels to distant sites in the body. In head and neck cancer, spread to the lymph nodes in the neck is relatively common.
 The lymph nodes most commonly involved depend on the location from which the primary tumor arises. Most lymph nodes are located along major blood vessels underneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle on each side of the neck. The risk of spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream is closely related to whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, how many nodes are involved, and their location in the neck. The risk is higher if cancer is in lymph nodes in the lower part of the neck rather than only in those located in the upper neck.
 The diagnosis of cancer of the head and neck is often made by a dentist, oral surgeon or physician after a patient notices symptoms such as a lump in the neck or a sore in the mouth that does not heal. Even without symptoms, the diagnosis may be made during a routine examination."
What are treatments for head and neck cancer?,"Radiation therapy, surgery, and chemotherapy are the three main treatments for head and neck cancer. Either radiation therapy, surgery, or both combined are typically used as the primary treatments with the goal of killing or removing the cancer. Chemotherapy is often used as an additional, or adjuvant, treatment. The optimal combination of the three treatment modalities for a patient with a particular head and neck cancer depends on the site of the cancer and the stage (extent) of the disease.
 In general, patients with early-stage head and neck cancers (particularly those limited to the site of origin) are treated with one primary therapy—either radiation therapy or surgery. Patients who have more advanced cancers are often treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy given together. Sometimes, depending on the clinical scenario, patients are treated with surgery followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
 If the plan of treatment is radiation therapy alone for the primary cancer, the neck is also treated with radiation therapy. In addition, surgery to remove involved lymph nodes in the neck (called a neck dissection) may be necessary if the amount of disease in the neck nodes is relatively extensive or if the cancer in the neck nodes has not been eliminated completely by the end of the radiation therapy course.
 In some situations, a surgeon may remove the primary tumor. Radiation may be given afterward, if necessary. In other situations, the cancer is too advanced and it is not feasible to completely remove the cancer with surgery initially. Radiotherapy may then be given first to try to shrink the tumor, and surgery may follow radiotherapy.
 Recent studies indicate that chemotherapy given at the same time as radiation therapy is more effective than if it is given before a course of radiation therapy. Therefore, radiation treatment schedules sometimes include chemotherapy if the stage of the cancer is advanced (advanced stage III or stage IV). Drugs most commonly given in conjunction with radiation therapy are cisplatin (Platinol) and Cetuximab (Erbitux). Occasionally, other drugs may include fluorouracil (5-FU, Adrucil), carboplatin (Paraplatin), and paclitaxel (Taxol). This is only a partial list of chemotherapy agents; your physicians may choose to use others. The chemotherapy may be given in a variety of ways, including a low daily dose, a moderately low weekly dose, or a relatively higher dose every three to four weeks.
 Typically, one of the following radiation therapy procedures may be used to treat Head and Neck Cancer:
 
 External beam therapy (EBT): EBT delivers a beam of high-energy x-rays or protons to the tumor. A machine generates and targets the radiation beam at the tumor site. EBT destroys cancer cells, and conformal treatment plans spare surrounding normal tissues from exposure. 
 Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): an advanced mode of high-precision radiotherapy that uses computer-controlled x-ray accelerators. The accelerators conform and deliver a precise radiation dose to the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of the tumor. The machines control the intensity of the radiation beam to focus a higher dose on the tumor and minimize radiation exposure to healthy cells.

What happens during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer?,"The initial visit to the radiation oncologist is for a consultation, when the radiation oncologist will listen to the history of your problem and perform a physical examination. Consultations with other members of the head and neck team, such as the head and neck surgeon, medical oncologist, pathologist, radiologist and dentist, usually take place at this time or shortly after. It is important to have the input of various members of the team who will be taking care of you before a treatment plan is decided and treatment begins.
 After the recommended treatment and possible options are explained to you and you decide on a course of treatment in conjunction with your doctors, a date will be selected for treatment planning for radiation therapy (if radiation therapy has been selected as the first or next step in your treatment). You then have what is called a ""simulation"" using either conventional radiographs (x-rays) or a computed tomography (CT) scan. These radiographic studies are used to plan the type and direction of radiation beams used to treat the cancer. Customized lead alloy blocks or a special collimator (multileaf collimator) in the treatment machine will shape the radiation beams to block areas that do not need to be treated. Treatment fields then will be aligned, and the treatment course will start one to two weeks after the initial treatment-planning session. There is significant medical physics involvement in the planning and verification of the plan before it is actually delivered to the patient.
 Typically, treatments are given once or twice a day, five days a week for five to seven weeks, depending on the treatment schedule selected by your radiation oncologist. Generally, for the first couple of days of treatment planning and treatment start, your visit to the radiation oncology department may take an hour or two. Thereafter, each individual treatment takes a shorter amount of time, which varies depending on the complexity of the set-up. You will not feel or see anything during a radiation treatment, although the machine makes a sound that may be heard during the treatment."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer,"The side effects depend on the site and extent of the head and neck cancer and whether it is done in conjunction with chemotherapy. In general, radiation therapy of the head and neck does not cause nausea, but a few patients do experience nausea during treatment. Many effective antiemetics (drugs that alleviate nausea) can relieve this symptom if it should occur. Chemotherapy will cause its own side effects which will be discussed with the medical oncologist.
 
 Generally, the side effects of radiation therapy become apparent about
 two weeks into the treatment course, when a sore throat, loss of taste
 sensation, dryness of the mouth and dry skin reactions may occur. Sore
 throat is the main side effect that makes the course of radiation therapy
 difficult.
 If your sore throat is severe, you may be unable to take in enough food and liquids by mouth to maintain your weight or avoid dehydration. Your doctors will then insert a feeding tube temporarily into your stomach (a gastrostomy tube), which will allow you to maintain adequate nutrition without having to swallow all of the food that you need. Gastrostomy placement is usually an outpatient procedure. It is important, though, to continue swallowing even with a gastrostomy tube in place. Otherwise, your swallowing muscles may weaken; this would cause permanent swallowing problems and make it difficult to stop using the gastrostomy tube even after the radiation treatment course is completed.
 A dietitian should be involved in your care during the course of radiation treatments to help you maintain adequate caloric intake and hydration. When side effects occur, it may be tempting to take a break from treatments. This is not a good idea. The ""acutely responding"" normal tissues—such as the skin and the lining of the throat—that are responsible for the side effects during radiation therapy tend to respond to radiation as do cancer cells. If the treatment produces few acute side effects, it is also not likely to be very effective against the cancer. Therefore, the treatment of most head and neck cancers represents a classic ""no pain, no gain"" situation. Breaks in the treatment course to lessen the side effects give the cancer a chance to regrow and will significantly reduce the likelihood of cure. Medications that are almost always needed during a course of radiation therapy include pain medicines, analgesic ""magic mouthwash"" for the sore throat to help swallowing, possibly antiemetics if nausea is a problem and possibly stool softeners to counteract some pain medication effects."
What are some of the possible risks or complications of treatment for head and neck cancer?,"A clear goal of treatment must be determined for each patient before therapy starts. The first question is often whether the goal of treatment is cure or, instead, the lessening (palliation) of symptoms associated with an incurable cancer. If cure is unlikely, then potential risks associated with treatment may be less than those associated with a potentially curative course of radiation therapy. However in head and neck cancer the planned radiation to achieve long term palliation may be the same as the curative course.
 Palliative courses of treatment generally entail giving a moderate dose
 of radiation over a short time. This provides a relatively high chance
 of shrinking the tumor and lessening symptoms while exposing the patient
 to less risk of side effects and complications, and requiring a relatively
 brief time to complete the therapy. A typical course of palliative radiation
 treatments would be divided into 10 treatments given over two weeks.
 On the other hand, if there is a reasonable chance of cure (the definition of reasonable can vary, depending on the situation, but generally at least 5 percent to 10 percent), then a longer and more arduous course of treatment is generally planned. The risks associated with treatment depend on the location and extent of the tumor and the normal structures that are nearby.
 
 In general, for any type of treatment, the treating physician tries to estimate the potential risk of a major complication; if this risk is similar to or exceeds the anticipated likelihood of cure, then the treatment plan is modified. However, if the likelihood of cure is significantly greater than the risk of a major complication, then treatment is initiated."
What kind of treatment follow-up for head and neck cancer?,"There are several reasons for follow-up examinations:
 
 To detect recurrent cancer and possibly try further treatment, such as an operation, if the radiation therapy is unsuccessful
 To treat the acute side effects of the radiation therapy
 To detect and treat late side effects or complications from the radiation therapy, should they occur
 To detect and treat additional, unrelated head and neck cancers that may arise
 
 If the initial treatment for the cancer is successful and you are cured, there is still a relatively low risk (2 percent to 3 percent per year) of developing a new, completely unrelated head and neck cancer. Per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, follow-up examinations usually take place:
 
 Every one to three months for the first year
 Every two months to six months for the second year
 Every four to eight months for the years three through five
 Annually thereafter
 
 Thyroid functions are often checked annually to detect any occurrence of hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function), which is easily treatable.
 Continued imaging follow-up is typically performed both to assess the response to treatment and to monitor for disease recurrence. CT scans are most commonly performed for this purpose, however, MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may also be performed in certain situations.
 Dental exams for oral cavity and sites exposed to significant intraoral radiation treatment."
Are there any new developments in treating head and neck cancer?,"Some new treatments are available, as are new ways of combining old treatments. A good example of the latter is the use in recent years of a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy or immunotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer. For updated information on new cancer treatments that are available, you should discuss these issues with your doctor and consider obtaining a second opinion before beginning treatment.

What is Radioembolization?,"Radioembolization is a minimally invasive outpatient procedure that involves the precise placement of microscopic radioactive spheres (microspheres) via a small catheter placed in directly in blood vessels that supply a tumor in the liver. The microspheres contain an isotope of yttrium-90, which generates therapeutic radiation for approximately two weeks before decaying away and becoming inactive."
What are some common uses of radioembolization?,"Radioembolization is used to treat tumors that were initially formed in the liver or have spread (or metastasized) to the liver from another part of the body. Radioembolization can effectively treat tumors as a sole therapy, help make some tumors eligible for curative surgery, and improve the quality of life in patients with liver cancers."
What are the steps to prepare for a radioembolization procedure?,"Several days before the procedure, you will have a clinic consultation with the interventional radiologist who will perform your procedure. 
 Prior to your procedure, your blood may be tested to determine how well your liver and kidneys are functioning and whether your blood clots normally.
 Tell your doctor about all the medications you take, including herbal supplements. List any allergies, especially to local anesthetic, general anesthesia or to contrast materials. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or blood thinners before your procedure.
 Tell your doctor about recent illnesses or other medical conditions.
 Women should always inform their physician and x-ray technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant. Many imaging tests are not performed during pregnancy so as not to expose the fetus to radiation. If an x-ray is necessary, precautions will be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the baby. See the Radiation Safety page for more information about pregnancy and x-rays.
 You will receive specific instructions on how to prepare, including any changes that need to be made to your regular medication schedule.
 You may be given a sedative prior to or during your treatments. You will receive specific instructions on eating and drinking before the procedure and will need to have a relative or friend accompany you and drive you home afterward.
 You will be given a gown to wear during the procedure."
What does a radioembolization machine look like?,"X-ray equipment, nuclear medicine equipment, catheters, and a box containing radioactive microspheres are used in this procedure. The microspheres are about the size of powdered sugar, and less than a teaspoon of them is used for treatment. 
 The equipment typically used for this examination consists of a radiographic table, one or two x-ray tubes and a television-like monitor in the examining room. Fluoroscopy, which converts x-rays into video images, is used to watch and guide progress of the procedure. The video is produced by the x-ray machine and a detector that is suspended over a table on which the patient lies.
 A catheter is a long, thin plastic tube that is considerably smaller than a “pencil lead”, or approximately 1/8 inch in diameter.
 Oher equipment that may be used during the procedure includes an intravenous line (IV), ultrasound machine and devices that monitor your heart beat and blood pressure."
How does radioembolization therapy work?,"There are two blood vessels that bring blood to the liver. Normal liver tissue receives about 75 percent of its blood supply from the portal vein and about 25 percent from the hepatic artery. 
 When a tumor grows in the liver, it receives almost all its blood supply from the hepatic artery. When microspheres are delivered through the hepatic artery, they accumulate preferentially in the tumor as opposed to the normal liver. Your interventional radiologist will only deliver microspheres to the portion of liver that contains tumor when possible.
 In contrast to traditional external beam radiation therapy, the radiation provided by radioembolization only travels a few millimeters from the microsphere. This property allows radioembolization to achieve high doses of radiation within the tumor, while preserving unaffected liver tissue from the effects of radiation.
 The microspheres will remain in the treated portion of your liver without causing any future problems. A small portion of microspheres may go to the lungs during treatment, but do not cause issues in most patients. 
 Some patients receive radioembolization with the specific goal of making them a better candidate for surgery. This treatment, commonly referred to as a radiation lobectomy, involves the infusion of radioactive microspheres to both tumor and the portion of liver the surgeon intends to remove. This treatment approach is enabled by the liver’s unique ability to regenerate, just like skin or bone. Over three to six months after radiation lobectomy, radiation effects in the treated tumor and liver will cause them to shrink while the untreated portion of liver - which will remain with the patient after surgery – grows, thereby reducing the chance of postoperative liver failure."
How is radioembolization performed?,"Radioembolization is performed by a specially trained interventional radiologist in an interventional radiology suite. Although radioembolization can be performed in one session in certain circumstances, it will commonly require two sessions. In the first session, a mapping angiogram, as described below, is performed to visualize the abdominal arteries.
  This procedure is often done on an outpatient basis. Rarely, some patients may require admission following the procedure. Ask your doctor if you will need to be admitted.
  You may be given medications to help prevent nausea and pain, and antibiotics to help prevent infection.
  You will be positioned on your back.
  You may be connected to monitors that track your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level and pulse.
  A nurse or technologist will insert an intravenous (IV) line into a vein in your hand or arm to administer a sedative. This procedure may use moderate sedation. It does not require a breathing tube. However, some patients may require general anesthesia.
  The area of your body where the catheter is to be inserted will be sterilized and covered with a surgical drape.
  Your physician will numb the area with a local anesthetic. This may briefly burn or sting before the area becomes numb.
  A very small skin incision is made at the site.
  Using image-guidance, a catheter (a long, thin, hollow plastic tube) is inserted through the skin into the radial or femoral artery, and maneuvered to the treatment site.
 A small catheter is placed within multiple arteries in the liver and a cone beam CT is performed to analyze its three-dimensional blood supply.
  Your interventional radiologist will choose the arteries that are supplying tumor and prescribe a personalized radiation dose to them. Occasionally, arteries that the interventional radiologist wishes to protect from unintentional exposure to radioactive microspheres, such as those that supply stomach and bowel, will be closed with tiny metallic coils.
  At the end of the procedure, a dissolvable particle made of protein containing a nuclear medicine tracer may be infused through the catheter into the liver to simulate treatment. This helps the interventional radiologist determine if you are a candidate for radioembolization based on the distribution of the simulated microspheres within the liver, abdomen, and lungs.
  If you are determined to be a candidate for radioembolization after your mapping angiogram and nuclear medicine exam, you will be brought back for a second procedure within two weeks where the therapeutic radioactive microspheres will be administered in a similar procedure. In some practices, a radiation oncologist or nuclear medicine doctor will additionally be present in the room and will be performing the actual delivery of the therapeutic radioactive microspheres.
  When the procedure is complete, the catheter is removed, and pressure is applied to stop any bleeding. Sometimes, your doctor may use a closure device to seal the small hole in the artery. This will allow you to move around more quickly. No stitches are visible on the skin. The tiny opening in the skin is covered with a dressing.
  Your IV line is removed before you go home.
  This procedure is usually completed within two hours."
What to expect during and after radioembolism procedure?,"Devices to monitor your heart rate and blood pressure will be attached to your body.
 You will feel a slight pinch when the needle is inserted into your vein for the IV line and when the local anesthetic is injected. Most of the sensation is at the skin incision site. This is numbed using local anesthetic. You may feel pressure when the catheter is inserted into the vein or artery. However, you will not feel serious discomfort. 
 If the procedure is done with sedation, the intravenous (IV) sedative will make you feel relaxed, sleepy, and comfortable for the procedure. You may or may not remain awake, depending on how deeply you are sedated.
 You may feel slight pressure when the catheter is inserted, but no serious discomfort.
 As the contrast material passes through your body, you may feel warm. This will quickly pass.
 Radioembolization is generally painless; however, some patients may experience brief pain when the microspheres are injected. Pain may develop in certain tumors over days to weeks due to normal inflammation related to tumor treatment. Rarely, pain in the upper abdomen may indicate the presence of a radiation-induced stomach or duodenum ulcer. These ulcers can be treated with medication and rarely need more invasive therapy. 
 You will remain in the recovery room until you are completely awake and ready to return home. 
 Occasionally, patients whose treatment requires a large number of microspheres experience post-embolization syndrome due to a temporary reduction in blood supply in the liver. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and fever. This can readily be controlled by medications given by mouth or your IV. These side effects usually subside within one to five days. You should tell your doctor if these symptoms last more than 10 days.
 When larger volumes of liver are treated, patients may experience a loss of appetite and fatigue that may start within a week and last up to a month or more in severe cases. However, this is rare, and most patients will be able to resume normal activities within days following the procedure.
 During the first week following your radioembolization, you will need to limit contact with others while the radiation in your body diminishes. You will be provided with specific recommendations by your doctor’s radiation safety officer, which may include warnings against: 
 
 sleeping in the same bed as your partner.
 using public transportation that requires you to sit next to another person for more than two hours.
 coming into close contact with children or pregnant women.
 
 CT scans
 or MRIs
 and laboratory examinations may be performed every one to three months following the treatment to determine treatment response."
What medical staff reviews the results of a radioembolization procedure and how can I access them?,"The interventional radiologist can advise you as to whether the procedure was a technical success when it is completed.
 Your interventional radiologist may recommend a follow-up visit.
 This visit may include a physical check-up, imaging exam(s) and blood tests. During your follow-up visit, tell your doctor about any side effects or changes you have noticed."
What are the benefits vs. risks of radioembolism?,"Benefits
 
 Radioembolization can prevent the progression of tumors and extend lives from months to years while preserving a patient’s quality of life. In select cases, it may enable curative surgery or liver transplantation. When very high-dose radioembolization is used, also known as ablative radioembolization or radiation segmentectomy, you may receive radioembolization as the only treatment for your tumor. 
 Radioembolization produces few side effects when compared to other liver cancer therapies.
 No surgical incision is necessary—only a small nick in the skin that does not need stitches. 
 A higher dose of radiation to the tumor is given during radioembolization than with standard external beam therapy.
 
 Risks
 
 Any procedure where the skin is penetrated carries a risk of infection. The chance of infection requiring antibiotic treatment appears to be less than one in 1,000.There is a very slight risk of an allergic reaction if contrast material is injected.
 Any procedure that places a catheter inside a blood vessel carries certain risks. These risks include damage to the blood vessel, bruising or bleeding at the puncture site, and infection. The doctor will take precautions to mitigate these risks.
 There is a small risk that the microspheres may lodge in the wrong place, which may result in an ulcer in the stomach or duodenum.
 Patients who have underlying liver disease, such as cirrhosis or multiple treatments with chemotherapy and receive radioembolization to large volumes of liver face a risk of transient or permanent liver failure. 
 There is a risk of infection after radioembolization, even if an antibiotic has been given, particularly in patients who have had stents placed in their bile ducts. 
 Occasionally, patients with large tumors are at risk for secondary radiation effects in their lungs, which can cause temporary or permanent respiratory issues. Patients at high risk for this side effect are usually identified during simulation, which is harmless to the lungs. Radioembolization treatment doses can be subsequently adjusted to a safe level, or the treatment can be cancelled when this is not possible."
What are the limitations of Radioembolization?,Radioembolization is not recommended in cases of severe liver dysfunction or where there is an unfavorable mapping angiogram or nuclear medicine simulation.
Who will perform IGRT?,"Radiation therapy requires a treatment team. The team may include a radiation oncologist,
 therapeutic medical physicist,
 dosimetrist and
 radiation therapists. The radiation oncologist decides which therapies to use, in which area(s), and the optimal therapeutic radiation dose. Radiation therapists obtain images and deliver daily treatments. The radiation oncology nurse provides information about the treatment and possible side effects. The nurse also helps manage any treatment reactions or side effects with supervision and guidance from radiation oncologists."
What equipment is used for IGRT?,IGRT uses a radiation delivery machine with built-in imaging equipment. Or the imaging equipment is mounted on the machine or in the treatment room. IGRT may use a detector that tracks motion by identifying markers on your body or electromagnetic transponders placed within.
Who operates the equipment in IGRt?,The radiation oncologist will create and supervise the treatment plan. A radiation therapist will operate the equipment.
How is igrt performed?,"At the start of each treatment, the radiation therapists carefully position you on the treatment couch. They may use devices to help you keep the same position. Sometimes, you will need to hold your breath for 30 to 60 seconds while the technologist takes a series of images. 
 On each treatment day, the therapist will first obtain images. The treatment team reviews and compares these images to the simulation images. The therapists may reposition you and take additional images. Once your therapists make final adjustments, they will deliver the treatment.
 The image-guidance process will add additional time to each treatment session."
What is Radioimmunotherapy and how is it used?,"RIT combines radiation therapy and immunotherapy. Immunotherapy uses man made monoclonal antibodies to recognize specific types of cancer cells and bind to their surface. Monoclonal antibodies mimic the natural antibodies your immune system produces, to attack bacteria and viruses.
 RIT pairs a monoclonal antibody with a radioactive material (radiotracer) to create an agent. The doctor injects the agent into your bloodstream. The agent binds to cancer cells and delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor. 
 RIT treats non-Hodgkin B-cell and other sub-types of lymphoma, prostate cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors. Doctors use it for new patients and for those who do not respond to chemotherapy or treatment with the agent Rituximab®. In prostate cancer, it is used in patients who become resistant to hormone treatment.
 Doctors are developing new RIT agents, some of which are in clinical trials. Potential uses for RIT include treatments for melanoma, ovarian cancer, leukemia, high-grade brain glioma , and colorectal cancer."
Who will be involved in a radio-immuno procedure?,"Your treatment team may include a radiologist, nuclear medicine physician, an oncologist, a radiation oncologist, medical physicist, a nurse or nurse practitioner, and a medical and/or radiation oncologist."
What equipment is used in radio-immuno?,"RIT uses an intravenous (IV) catheter. It may also use a gamma camera to capture images before or after treatment. The doctor may use single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) imaging. SPECT-CT uses a combined gamma camera and CT scanner that rotates around the body to produce detailed, three-dimensional images. A PET-CT may also be used before or after your treatment. It is an advanced combination of a nuclear medicine imaging system and a CT scan.
 A gamma camera detects radiation and takes pictures from different angles. It may be mounted over or below the exam table or on a gantry. One camera may be above, and another camera may be beneath the table, or the camera may consist of a donut-shaped detector where you will lie on a bed that moves slowly through the detector for imaging."
Who is in charge of running the radio-immuno equipment?,A radiologist or other doctor with nuclear medicine training will supervise your treatment. A technologist will operate the gamma camera.
Is there any special preparation needed before a radioimmunology test?,"Tell your doctor about all the medications you take, including herbal supplements. List any allergies, especially to local anesthetic, general anesthesia or to contrast materials. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or blood thinners before your procedure. Tell your doctor if you have trouble emptying your bladder or have trouble with bladder control.
  Women should always tell their doctor and technologist if they are pregnant or breastfeeding. Doctors generally do not treat pregnant women or children with RIT. See the Radiation Safety page for more information about pregnancy, breastfeeding, and nuclear medicine imaging.
  The doctor will check your blood counts. The doctor will also confirm that your disease is not significantly impacting your bone marrow. Patients who have experience with bone marrow transplant or failed stem cell collection should not receive RIT. Your doctor may follow your blood counts after the procedure for some time to make sure your counts are normal.
 A radiation safety specialist will discuss radiation safety precautions with you."
How is a radioimmunoassay performed?,"Your doctor will usually treat you as an outpatient. This will require several separate visits.
 Before your radioimmunotherapy, you may receive an IV dose of the antibody (without radioactive material) or an infusion of amino acids, depending on what type of cancer is being treated. The antibody attaches to non-malignant B cells in your body and the amino acid infusion protects your kidneys from the radiation that RIT uses. The IV infusions may take up to two hours. The radioimmunotherapy will be given via intravenous infusion. You will be asked to use the bathroom before and after the procedure. Depending on the type of cancer being treated, the therapy may last anywhere from 2 hours to 6 hours. Your doctor will explain the procedure to you with more detailed information specific to your cancer."
What sensations can you expect during a radioimmunology procedure?,"Except for intravenous injections, RIT is relatively painless. Reports of significant discomfort or side effects are rare. You will feel a slight pin prick when the technologist inserts the needle into your vein for the intravenous line. You may feel a cold sensation moving up your arm when they inject the radiotracer. Generally, there are no other side effects."
Are there side effects from a radio-immuno procedure?,"There is a small risk of bone marrow damage. Lower blood counts are the most serious side effect. This may occur as late as several months after treatment. It is important to follow up with your doctor regularly because it may lead to bleeding or infection. Frequent blood draws will help monitor your blood counts. 
 Other side effects may include allergic reaction, fever, chills, low blood pressure, diarrhea, and rash. These possible side effects are usually short-term.
 Hypersensitivity reactions from the monoclonal antibodies are rare. However, the risk of reaction increases with the number of treatments. Typically, your doctor will pretreat you with acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl®)."
Who will be involved in the IMRT procedure?,"Most facilities rely on a specially trained team for IMRT delivery. This team includes the radiation oncologist, medical
 physicist, dosimetrist,
 radiation
 therapist and radiation therapy nurse.
 The radiation oncologist, a specially trained physician, first consults with the patient to determine whether IMRT is the most appropriate treatment. After obtaining informed consent, the individualized course of treatment is planned.
 A radiation physicist, who has specialized training in the field of medical physics, ensures the linear accelerator delivers the precise radiation dose and that computerized dose calculations are accurate.
 A dosimetrist works with the medical physicist to develop the IMRT plan and beam configurations necessary to deliver the dose prescribed by the radiation oncologist.
 The final treatment plan is verified by the medical physicist on the treatment machine using a phantom (a device that simulates the human body) that measures the dose delivered by the treatment plan. This ensures that the dose planned by the radiation oncologist is the dose delivered by the machine.
 A radiation therapist positions the patient on the treatment table and operates the machine.
 The oncology nurse assesses the patient during the course of treatment and provides the patient with additional information about the treatment and possible adverse reactions. The radiation oncology nurse also helps in managing any reactions or side effects from treatment that may occur, in collaboration with the physician."
What equipment is used in IMRT?,"A medical linear accelerator (LINAC) generates the photons, or x-rays, used in IMRT. The machine is the size of a small car—approximately 10 feet high and 15 feet long. During the treatment, the patient must lie still. The intensity of each beam's radiation dose is dynamically varied according to treatment plan. The patient will not feel any sensation while the radiation is on, but will hear noise from the machine, and may smell an odor from the electronic equipment, or see the warning indicator light. The noises and odors from the machine are normal. The patient will be in the room alone during treatment but is constantly monitored by the radiation therapists from outside the treatment room. The time in the treatment room depends on the specific plan, but usually is between 15 minutes and one hour.
 See the Linear Accelerator page for more information."
Who operates IMRT equipment?,The radiation therapist operates the equipment from a radiation-protected area nearby. The radiation therapist is able to communicate with the patient throughout treatment and observes the patient on closed-circuit television.
Is there any special preparation needed for the procedure?,"Before planning treatment, a physical examination and medical history review will be conducted. Next, there is a treatment simulation session, which includes CT scanning. A small mark or tattoo may be placed on the patient's skin to help align and target the equipment. The radiation oncologist uses this scan to make an individual plan for the patient. In some cases, a mask or other device to keep the patient still during treatment will be made. Sometimes the patient is instructed to follow a certain bowel and bladder preparation regimen or to fast prior to the simulation and treatment. Intravenous contrast material may be injected during the CT scan to help define the tumor better.
 Occasionally, additional scanning procedures, including positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), might also be required for IMRT planning. These diagnostic images can be merged with the planning CT and help the radiation oncologist determine the precise location of the tumor target.
 In some cases, it is necessary to insert radio dense markers into the target for more accurate positioning. Typically, IMRT sessions begin about a week or two after simulation."
How does IMRT treatment work?,"IMRT often requires multiple (fractionated) treatment sessions on different days. The radiation oncologist considers the type, location and size of the tumor, doses to normal structures, and the patient's health to decide the number of treatments. Typically, patients are scheduled for IMRT sessions five days a week for five to eight weeks.
 At the beginning of the treatment session, the radiation therapist positions the patient on the treatment table, guided by the marks on the skin (tattoos) defining the treatment area. If molded devices were made, they will be used to help the patient maintain the proper position. The patient may be repositioned during the procedure. Imaging systems on the treatment machine such as x-ray or CT may be used to check positioning and marker location. Treatment sessions usually take between 15 and 60 minutes."
What will I feel during and after this procedure?,"As with other external beam radiation therapy treatments, there is no pain expected during the actual treatments with IMRT. However, the machine can be stopped if a patient experiences discomfort due to the treatment position or positioning devices. As treatment progresses, some patients may experience treatment-related side effects. The nature of the side effects depend on the normal tissue structures near the tumor that are being irradiated. The radiation oncologist and the nurse will discuss potential side effects and the management of those side effects.
 Radiation treatment can cause side effects. These problems may result from the treatment itself or from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area.
 The number and severity of side effects will depend on the type of radiation, dose, and body part under treatment. Talk to your doctor and/or nurse so they can help manage them.
 Radiation can cause early and late side effects. Early side effects happen during or right after treatment. They are typically gone within a few weeks. Common early side effects include fatigue and skin problems. Skin in the treatment area may become sensitive, red, irritated, or swollen. Other changes include dryness, itching, peeling, and blistering.
 Depending on the area being treated, other early side effects may include:
 
 hair loss in the treatment area
 mouth problems and difficulty swallowing
 eating and digestion problems
 diarrhea
 nausea and vomiting
 headaches
 soreness and swelling in the treatment area
 urinary and bladder changes
 
 Late side effects may occur months or years following treatment. While they are often permanent, they are rare. They include:
 
 brain changes
 spinal cord changes
 lung changes
 kidney changes
 colon and rectal changes
 infertility
 joint changes
 lymphedema
 mouth changes
 secondary cancer
 
 There is a slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. After treatment, your radiation oncologist will regularly check for complications and recurrent or new cancers.
 Using techniques such as IMRT, radiation oncologists maximize the cancer-destroying capabilities of radiation treatment while minimizing its effect on healthy tissues and organs side effects."
What equipment is used in stereotactic?,"There are three basic kinds of equipment, each of which uses different instruments and sources of radiation:
 
 The Gamma Knife®, which uses 192 or 201 beams of highly focused gamma rays all aiming at the target region. The Gamma Knife is ideal for treating small to medium size intracranial lesions. See the Gamma Knife page for more information.
 Linear accelerator (LINAC) machines, prevalent throughout the world, deliver high-energy x-rays, also known as photons. The linear accelerator can perform SRS on larger tumors in a single session or during multiple sessions, which is called fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Multiple manufacturers make this type of machine, which have brand names such as Novalis Tx™, XKnife™, Axesse™ and CyberKnife®. See the Linear Accelerator page for more information.
 Proton beam or heavy-charged-particle radiosurgery is in limited use in North America, though the number of centers offering proton therapy has increased dramatically in the last several years. See the Proton Therapy page for more information."
Who will perform the stereotactic procedure?,"The treatment team is comprised of a number of specialized medical professionals, typically including a radiation oncologist, medical radiation physicist, radiologist, dosimetrist, radiation therapist, and radiation therapy nurse.
 
 The radiation oncologist and, in some cases, a neurosurgeon lead the treatment team and oversee the treatment; they outline the target(s) to be treated, identify any sensitive tissues or organs at risk, decide on the appropriate radiation dose, approve the treatment plan, and interpret the results of radiosurgical procedures.
 A radiologist interprets imaging that identifies the target(s) to be treated in the brain or body.
 The medical radiation physicist ensures the delivery of the precise dose of radiation.
 The physicist, or a dosimetrist under the supervision of the physicist, uses special computer software to devise a treatment plan; he or she calculates the exposures and beam configuration to conformally treat the target(s) to the prescribed dose.
 A highly trained radiation therapist positions the patient on the treatment table and operates the machine from an adjacent protected area. The radiation therapist can observe the patient through a window or on a closed-circuit television and is able to communicate with the patient throughout the procedure. In the case of the Gamma Knife, the neurosurgeon and/or radiation oncologist may help position the patient for treatment and the radiation oncologist may operate the machine.
 The radiation therapy nurse assesses the patient, provides the patient with information about the treatment, monitors the patient during treatment, and helps answer questions after treatment.
 A neurologist or neuro-oncologist may participate with the radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon in the multidisciplinary team that considers various treatment options for individual cases and helps decide who may benefit from radiosurgery for lesions in the brain."
How is a stereotactic procedure performed?,"• Stereotactic Radiosurgery Using the Gamma Knife
 
 Gamma Knife radiosurgery involves four phases: placement of the head frame, imaging of the tumor location, computerized dose planning, and radiation delivery. Under some circumstances, some facilities may use a plastic head mask instead of the head frame.
 In the first phase, a nurse will place a small needle in your hand or arm to give you medications and contrast, if needed, for imaging. A neurosurgeon will use local anesthesia to numb two spots on your forehead and two spots on the back of your head. A box-shaped head frame will be attached to your skull using specially designed pins to keep your head from moving within the frame until the treatment session is finished. This lightweight aluminum head frame is also a guiding device that makes sure the Gamma Knife beams are focused exactly where the treatment is needed.
 Next, you will be taken to an imaging area where a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed to show the exact location of the tumor in relation to the head frame. In some cases, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be performed instead of, or in addition to, an MRI scan. If you are having treatment for an arteriovenous malformation, you may also have an angiogram. New developments in Gamma Knife software allow for pre-planning. Therefore, you may have your treatment planning MR images prior to the day of your treatment to improve the efficiency of the treatment process.
 During the next phase, you will be able to relax for an hour or two while your treatment team identifies the tumor(s) for treatment and develops a treatment plan using special computer software to optimally irradiate the tumor and minimize dose to surrounding normal tissues.
 Next, you will lie down on the Gamma Knife bed and your head frame will be fixed to the machine before beginning treatment. You will be made comfortable with a pillow or wedge-shaped sponge under your knees and a blanket over you. The treatment team will then go to the control area outside the treatment room to begin your treatment. You will be able to talk to your physician through a microphone in the helmet, and a camera will allow the team to see you at all times. The bed you are lying on will move backward into the Gamma Knife machine. You will not feel the treatment and the machine is very quiet. Depending on the Gamma Knife model and the treatment plan, the whole treatment may be performed without interruption or it may be broken up into multiple smaller parts. The total treatment may last less than one hour or up to four hours. A chime will sound when the treatment is complete and the bed will return to its original position. As soon as the treatment is finished, you will sit up and the head frame will be removed. In most cases, you should be able to go home soon afterward.
 
 • Radiosurgery Using the Linear Accelerator
 
 Linear accelerator (LINAC) SRS is similar to the Gamma Knife procedure and its four phases: head frame placement, imaging, computerized dose planning and radiation delivery. LINAC technology is much more common than Gamma Knife technology and has been in practice for a similar length of time. Unlike the Gamma Knife, which remains motionless during the procedure, part of the LINAC machine (called a gantry) rotates around the patient delivering the radiation beams from different angles. Obtaining the MRI before frame placement is also a more routine pre-planning practice with LINAC-based SRS. A CT with the frame in place is also commonly acquired.
 When SRS is delivered using CyberKnife, a robotic arm moves the compact LINAC around the patient under image-guidance. The CyberKnife is also based on delivering SRS without an invasive head frame, and a more simple plastic head mask can be used to keep the head from moving during delivery which can improve patient comfort. The development of frameless SRS is possible due to the incorporation of image-guidance in the delivery of treatment. Now, most LINAC based SRS technology is moving towards frameless SRS. The Gamma Knife has also developed frameless technology in order to spare the patient the invasive frame placement procedure. Frameless SRS also allows for fractionated SRS, or SBRT, which again may be an advantage for large tumors or those in particularly critical locations.
 
 • SBRT
 
 SBRT typically consists of one to five treatment sessions delivered over the course of one to two weeks.
 For some technologies like the CyberKnife that base image-guidance according to an x-ray based solution, you may be asked to have a fiducial marker placed in or near your tumor for selected cases. However, for most CT based image-guidance technologies, this step is not needed. If a fiducial is required, depending on the location of your tumor, your radiation oncologist may work with a pulmonologist, gastroenterologist or radiologist to have one to four fiducial markers placed near the tumor. Placement of the fiducial marker is almost always an outpatient procedure.
 Next, your radiation oncologist will determine the method of aligning your body with the beams from the linear accelerator, which is called a simulation. Immobilization devices are often used to align patients very precisely and make sure they remain still during simulation and treatment. Some of these systems may hold you quite tight; therefore you should tell your physician if you suffer from claustrophobia. After an immobilization device is created for you, a CT scan is performed over the area to be treated. Your physicians may also perform a '4DCT,' where the CT scan obtains information on how your tumor moves while you breathe. This is very common for tumors in the lungs or liver. After the scan is completed, you will be sent home.
 The third part of the course is planning. The radiation oncologist will work with a radiation dosimetrist and medical physicist to plan the beam arrangement best suited for your tumor. They may incorporate other imaging techniques, such as MRI or PET/CT. Using specialized software, the team will go through hundreds of different combinations of beams to figure out which would be best for your situation.
 Radiation delivery of SBRT is done on a linear accelerator. There are normally no restrictions on eating or drinking, though some patients may take an anti-inflammatory, anti-nausea or anti-anxiety medication prior to the treatment. You will be placed in the immobilization device. X-rays or a CT scan (depending on the mode of image-guidance specific to the LINAC technology) will be taken to line up the beams of radiation with the tumor prior to starting the radiation therapy. The radiation therapist will position you with guidance from the radiation oncologist based on these x-rays. The radiation therapist will then deliver the treatment. Sometimes, x-rays or a CT scan will be taken during the treatment to monitor the position of the tumor. Treatment can take up to one hour or more."
What will I feel during and after the stereotactic radiosurgery procedure?,"Radiosurgery treatments are similar to having an x-ray. In general you will not be able to see, feel or hear the x-rays. One exception is that some patients who are having treatments to the brain may see flashes of light while the machine is on, even with their eyes closed. There is no pain or discomfort from the actual treatment.
 If you experience pain for other reasons, such as back pain or discomfort from the head frame or immobilization device, you should let your doctor or nurse know.
 When the head frame is removed, there may be some minor bleeding from the pin sites that will be bandaged. You may experience a headache and can ask for medication to help make you feel more comfortable.
 In most cases, radiosurgery and SBRT patients can resume all of their normal activities within one or two days.
 Side effects of radiation treatment include problems that occur as a result of the treatment itself as well as from radiation damage to healthy cells in the treatment area.
 The number and severity of side effects you experience will depend on the type of radiation and dosage you receive and the part of your body being treated. You should talk to your doctor and nurse about any side effects you experience so they can help you manage them.
 Radiation therapy can cause early side effects during or immediately after treatment, and are typically gone within a few weeks. Late side effects can occur months or years later. Common early side effects of radiation therapy include tiredness or fatigue and skin problems. Skin in the treatment area may become more sensitive, red, irritated, or swollen. Other skin changes include dryness, itching, peeling and blistering.
 Depending on the area being treated, other early side effects may include:
 
 hair loss in the treatment area
 mouth problems and difficulty swallowing
 eating and digestion problems
 diarrhea
 nausea and vomiting
 headaches
 soreness and swelling in the treatment area
 urinary and bladder changes
 
 Late side effects, which are rare, occur months or years following treatment and are often permanent. They include:
 
 brain changes
 spinal cord changes
 lung changes
 kidney changes
 colon and rectal changes
 infertility
 joint changes
 lymphedema
 mouth changes
 secondary cancer
 fracture of bones
 
 There is a slight risk of developing cancer from radiation therapy. Following radiation treatment for cancer, you should be checked on a regular basis by your radiation oncologist for recurring and new cancers.
 Using techniques such as SBRT, the aim is to maximize the cancer-destroying capabilities of radiation treatment while minimizing its effect on healthy tissues to limit the side effects of the treatment itself."
What are Intracranial Vascular Treatments?,"Intracranial vascular treatments are minimally invasive procedures that, depending on the patient's condition, involve image-guided internal catheter navigation of the body's blood vessels to treat vascular conditions affecting the intracranial vessels.
 Techniques include:
 Endovascular therapy
 
 Endovascular therapy refers to precise treatments involving navigation of blood vessels internally with catheters, such as:
 
 Embolization: synthetic solid or liquid materials called embolic agents are placed through a catheter into a blood vessel or blood vessel abnormality to prevent blood flow to a specific area. Commonly used embolic agents include coils, particles or microspheres, liquid agents that harden, liquid agents that sclerose blood vessels, and Gelfoam.
 Drug delivery: medications are delivered very precisely through a catheter to specific locations in the brain through the blood vessels. These drugs include thrombolytic agents to dissolve clots, drugs to relax blood vessels in spasm, or chemotherapy drugs for cancer.
 Device delivery: permanently implanted or temporary medical devices that are placed through a catheter. These include:
  
 Stents: small tubes used to open blood vessels, redirect blood flow or stabilize other devices such as coils.
 Balloons: devices used to open blood vessels (angioplasty) or assist in the placement of other embolic agents or devices. See the Angioplasty and Vascular Stenting page for more information.
 Coils: devices that block blood flow. Coils are most commonly used in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.
 
 
 Mechanical retrievers/aspiration systems: used to remove clots causing stroke or embolic devices or debris.
 
 
 Stereotactic Radiotherapy
 
 Stereotactic radiosurgery is a precise form of radiation therapy that uses highly focused x-rays to eliminate abnormal blood vessels."
What are some common uses of Intracranial Vascular procedures?,"Intracranial vascular treatments are sometimes used to occlude (block) vessels or a blood vessel abnormality. Diseases that are often treated in this manner include:
 
 arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a tangle of dilated blood vessels that disrupts normal blood flow in the brain.
 arteriovenous fistula (AVF), an abnormal connection or passageway between an artery and a vein. 
 intracranial aneurysms, a ballooning out of the wall of an artery inside the brain that can rupture and bleed heavily.
 tumors with excessive blood flow.
 
 Intracranial vascular treatments can also be used to improve blood flow, including:
 
 acute stroke treatment.
 opening narrow blood vessels to prevent stroke.
 treatment of intracranial vasospasm, or tension/contracting of blood vessels."
What steps can you take to prepare for an intracranial vascular issue?,"Prior to your procedure, your doctor may test your blood to check your kidney function and to determine if your blood clots normally.
 Tell your doctor about all the medications you take, including herbal supplements. List any allergies, especially to local anesthetic,
  general anesthesia, or
  contrast materials.
  Your doctor may tell you to stop taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or blood thinners before your procedure.
 Tell your doctor about recent illnesses or other medical conditions.
 Women should always tell their doctor and technologist 
 if they are pregnant. Doctors may not perform many tests during pregnancy to avoid exposing the fetus to radiation. If an x-ray is necessary, the doctor will take precautions to minimize radiation exposure to the baby. See the Radiation Safety page for more information about pregnancy and x-rays.
 You will receive specific instructions on how to prepare, including any changes you need to make to your regular medication schedule.
 Other than medications, your doctor may tell you to not eat or drink anything for several hours before your procedure.
 The nurse will give you a gown to wear during the procedure.
 Endovascular procedures: 
 
 You should plan to stay overnight at the hospital for one or more days.
 
 Stereotactic radiosurgery: 
 
 If you need sedation, have someone accompany you and drive you home afterward.
 You should also tell your physician if any of the following apply to you:
 
 You are taking medications by mouth or insulin to control diabetes.
 You have a pacemaker, artificial heart valve, defibrillator, brain aneurysm clips, implanted pumps or chemotherapy ports, neurostimulators, eye or ear implants, stents, coils or filters.
 You suffer from claustrophobia."
What does an intracranial vascular instrument look like?,"Endovascular therapy:
 
 These procedures, similar to surgery, are performed in specific rooms or suites, using specific tools and involving highly trained personnel. X-ray equipment, catheters and a variety of synthetic materials, medications, embolic agents, detachable coils and other devices may be used.
 The equipment typically used consists of a fluoroscopic angiography suite with a procedure table, movable x-ray sources and detectors on opposite sides of the table, and television-like monitors for viewing images produced by the x-ray equipment. Monitors are located in the examining room and in a nearby control room with a structure allowing real-time viewing by the treating doctors suspended over the procedure table on which the patient lies. Typically, anesthetic equipment is present as well as physiologic monitoring equipment for use during the procedures, including an intravenous line (IV) and equipment that monitors heartbeat, blood pressure and oxygenation level.
 Catheters are small tubes made of synthetic material and coated with a lubricating layer. They vary in size and length depending upon specific uses. Commonly, longer, smaller catheters are placed through larger, shorter catheters to allow navigation of the body's blood vessels.
 Your physician will select an embolic agent depending on the type of disease being treated, size of the blood vessel, aneurysm or malformation and whether the treatment is intended to be permanent or temporary. These include:
 
 coils made of platinum that are used to block or occlude aneurysms or arteries. They can be positioned very precisely to occlude an aneurysm or stop bleeding from an injured artery. 
 a new technology called flow diverter stents that treat specific types of brain aneurysms. These special stents redirect blood flow out of the aneurysm.
 liquid sclerosing agents such as alcohol, which are used to destroy blood vessels and vessel malformations. Filling a vessel or a vascular malformation with this liquid agent causes blood clots to form, closing up the abnormal vascular channels.
 liquid embolic agents. When injected into the target channel that needs to be closed off, these block blood flow by quickly hardening.
 Gelfoam™, a gelatin sponge material, which is cut into small pieces that are injected into an artery and float downstream until they can go no further. After a period ranging from a few days to two weeks, the material dissolves. 
 particulate agents, including Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and gelatin-impregnated acrylic polymer spheres, which are suspended in liquid and injected into the bloodstream to block small vessels. These agents are used to block or occlude vessels permanently, including the treatment of uterine fibroid tumors.
 a balloon or stent used to unblock blood vessels to improve blood flow to the brain. In cases of acute stroke where a blood clot blocks a main artery in the brain, thrombectomy is performed with the use of stents or retrieval/aspiration systems.
 
 Aneurysm coils are made of soft platinum wire smaller than a strand of hair that is wound into complex shapes. Various detachment mechanisms allow for precise, controlled placement by the treating physician. They are available in different diameters and lengths.
 All detachable coils are scientifically proven to be safe and effective and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 There are three types of embolic coils:
 
 bare platinum coils
 coated platinum coils
 biologically active coils
 
 
 Stereotactic radiosurgery: 
 
 There are three basic kinds of stereotactic radiosurgery equipment, each of which uses different instruments and sources of radiation:
 
 The Gamma Knife®, which uses 192 or 201 beams of highly focused gamma rays all aiming at the target region. The Gamma Knife is ideal for treating small to medium size lesions. See the Gamma Knife page for more information.
 Linear accelerator (LINAC) machines, prevalent throughout the world, deliver high-energy x-rays, also known as photons. The linear accelerator can perform radiosurgery on larger tumors in a single session or during multiple sessions, which is called fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Multiple manufacturers make this type of machine, which have brand names such as Novalis Tx™, XKnife™, and CyberKnife®. See the Linear Accelerator page for more information.
 Proton beam or heavy-charged-particle radiosurgery is in limited use in North America, though the number of centers offering proton therapy has increased dramatically in the last several years. See the Proton Therapy page for more information."
How does the procedure for treating intracranial vascul work?,"Endovascular therapy:
 
 Embolization: Using x-ray imaging and a contrast material to visualize the blood vessel, the interventional neuroradiologist inserts a catheter through the skin into a blood vessel and advances it to the treatment site. A device or synthetic material called an embolic agent is then inserted through the catheter and positioned within the blood vessel, aneurysm or malformation where it will remain permanently, causing blockage of blood flow. In the case of brain aneurysms, commonly treated with devices called coils, the body responds by forming blood clots around the coil(s), which helps block the flow of blood into the bulge or passageway and keeps the aneurysm from rupturing or leaking. See the Embolization of Brain Aneurysms and Arteriovenous Malformations/Fistulas page for more information.
 Stroke Treatment: Using fluoroscopic x-ray imaging and contrast material to visualize blocked or narrow blood vessels, the interventional neuroradiologist inserts a catheter system through the skin into a blood vessel and advances it to the blockage. Devices such as stent retrievers/aspiration systems to open narrow blood vessels or remove clots can then be advanced through the catheter. Medications that dissolve clots or relax blood vessel spasms can also be injected.
 
 Stereotactic radiosurgery:
 
 Stereotactic radiosurgery is a highly precise form of radiation therapy used primarily to treat tumors and other abnormalities of the brain. Despite its name, stereotactic radiosurgery is a non-surgical procedure that delivers a single high-dose of precisely-targeted radiation using highly focused gamma-ray or x-ray beams that converge on the specific area or areas of the brain where the tumor or other abnormality resides, minimizing the amount of radiation to health brain tissue. When treated with radiosurgery, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) begin to thicken and close off slowly, typically over several years."
How is an intracranial vascular procedure performed?,"Endovascular therapy:
 
 Prior to your procedure, your doctor may perform ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams. 
 You will lie on the procedure table.
 The doctor or nurse may connect you to monitors that track your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, and pulse.
 A nurse or technologist will insert an intravenous (IV) line into a vein in your hand or arm to administer a sedative. This procedure may use moderate sedation. It does not require a breathing tube. However, some patients may require general anesthesia.
 Your doctor will numb the area with a local anesthetic. This may briefly burn or sting before the area becomes numb.
 The nurse will sterilize the area of your body where the catheter is to be inserted. They will sterilize and cover this area with a surgical drape. 
 The doctor will make a very small skin incision at the site.
 Catheter embolization: Using imaging guidance, a catheter (a long, thin, hollow plastic tube) is inserted through the skin into a blood vessel and maneuvered to the treatment site.
 Contrast material is injected through the catheter and a series of x-rays are taken to locate the exact site of bleeding or abnormality. The medication or embolic agent is then injected through the catheter. Additional x-rays are taken to ensure proper treatment of the abnormality.
 You can expect to stay in bed for six to eight hours after your procedure.
 The length of the procedure varies from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the complexity of the condition.
 Embolization of brain aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations: Using image-guidance, a catheter, a long, thin, hollow plastic tube, is inserted through the skin into a blood vessel and maneuvered to the treatment site. A contrast material is then injected through the catheter and a series of x-rays are taken to locate the exact site of the abnormality.
 The medication, embolic agent or device is then injected or advanced through the catheter. Additional x-rays are taken to ensure proper treatment of the abnormality.
 When the procedure is complete, the doctor will remove the catheter and apply pressure to stop any bleeding. Sometimes, your doctor may use a closure device to seal the small hole in the artery. This will allow you to move around more quickly. No stitches are visible on the skin. The nurse will cover this tiny opening in the skin with a dressing.
 Occasionally, a device or plug will be used to seal over or close the hole in the artery. This allows patients to return to their normal activities more quickly.
 The doctor or nurse will remove your IV line before you go home.
 The length of the procedure varies from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the complexity of the condition.
 You can expect to stay in bed for six to eight hours after your procedure.
 
 Stereotactic radiosurgery:
 
 Gamma Knife radiosurgery involves four phases: placement of the head frame, imaging of the tumor location, computerized dose planning, and radiation delivery. In the first phase, a nurse will place a small needle in your hand or arm to give you medications and a contrast material, if needed, for imaging.
 A neurosurgeon will use local anesthesia to numb two spots on your forehead and two spots on the back of your head. A box-shaped head frame will be attached to your skull using specially designed pins to keep your head from moving until the treatment session is finished. This lightweight aluminum head frame is also a guiding device that makes sure the Gamma Knife beams are focused exactly where the treatment is needed.
 Next, you will be taken to an imaging area where a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed to show the exact location of the tumor in relation to the head frame. In some cases, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be performed instead of, or in addition to, an MRI scan. If you are having treatment for an arteriovenous malformation, you may also have an angiogram.
 During the next phase, you will be able to relax for an hour or two while your treatment team identifies the tumor(s) for treatment and develops a treatment plan using special computer software to specifically pinpoint and optimally irradiate the tumor and minimize dose to surrounding normal tissues.
 Next, you will lie down on the Gamma Knife bed and your head frame will be fixed to the machine before beginning treatment. You will be made comfortable with a pillow or wedge-shaped sponge under your knees and a blanket over you. The treatment team will then go to the control room outside of the treatment room to begin your treatment. You will be able to talk to your physician through a microphone in the helmet and a camera will allow the team to see you at all times. The bed you are lying on will move backward into the Gamma Knife machine. You will not feel the treatment and the machine is very quiet. 
 Depending on the Gamma Knife model and the treatment plan, the whole treatment may be performed without interruption or it may be broken up into multiple smaller parts. The total treatment may last less than one hour or up to four hours. A chime will sound when the treatment is complete and the bed will return to its original position. As soon as the treatment is finished, you will sit up and the head frame will be removed. In most cases, you should be able to go home soon afterward.
 Linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery is similar to the Gamma Knife procedure and its four phases: head frame placement, imaging, computerized dose planning and radiation delivery. Unlike the Gamma Knife, which remains motionless during the procedure, part of the LINAC machine called a gantry rotates around the patient, delivering radiation beams from different angles. Compared to the Gamma Knife, the LINAC uses a larger x-ray beam, which enables larger tumors to be treated more uniformly. It can be used for fractionated radiosurgery or stereotactic radiotherapy using a relocatable frame, which is an advantage for large tumors or particularly critical locations.
 For CyberKnife radiosurgery, a head frame is not necessary. Instead, a plastic mesh mask will be made to help hold your head in position and a detailed CT scan will be performed with your mask on. You may also have an MRI scan to align with this CT scan in the treatment planning computer. The imaging, treatment planning, and first treatment may be spread out over multiple days. You may have up to five treatments over the span of one or one and a half weeks. 
 For the treatment, you will lie down and the mask will be placed over your head. X-ray images will be taken to ensure that you are in proper position, and then the treatment will begin. Your radiation therapist will monitor you at all times from outside the treatment room. The robotic arm will move around you to aim at the target from a hundred or several hundred directions. Your head won't have to remain perfectly still during treatment; x-ray images taken every minute or so will detect any small movements of your head and the robot will correct for these small movements to ensure accuracy throughout the treatment. The treatment may last about one or two hours."
What will I experience during and after the intracranial vascular treatments,"Endovascular therapy:
 
 The doctor or nurse will attach devices to your body to monitor your heart rate and blood pressure.
 You will feel a slight pinch when the nurse inserts the needle into your vein for the IV line and when they inject the local anesthetic. Most of the sensation is at the skin incision site. The doctor will numb this area using local anesthetic. You may feel pressure when the doctor inserts the catheter into the vein or artery. However, you will not feel serious discomfort.
 If you receive a general anesthetic, you will be unconscious for the entire procedure. An anesthesiologist will monitor your condition.
 If the procedure uses sedation, you will feel relaxed, sleepy, and comfortable. You may or may not remain awake, depending on how deeply you are sedated.
 You may feel slight pressure when the doctor inserts the catheter, but no serious discomfort.
 As the contrast material passes through your body, you may feel warm. This will quickly pass.
 
 Stereotactic radiosurgery:
 
 Radiosurgery treatments are similar to having an x-ray. You will not be able to see, feel or hear the x-rays. There is no pain or discomfort from the actual treatment. If you experience pain for other reasons, such as back pain or discomfort from the head frame, you should let your doctor or nurse know.
 When the head frame is removed, there may be some minor bleeding from the pin sites that will be bandaged. You may experience a headache and can ask for medication to help make you feel more comfortable. In most cases, patients can resume all of their normal activities within one or two days."
"What doctor or medical professional interprets the results, and how do I get them?","After the procedure is complete, the interventional radiologist will tell you whether the procedure was a success.
 Your interventional radiologist may recommend a follow-up visit.
 This visit may include a physical check-up, imaging exam(s), and blood tests. During your follow-up visit, tell your doctor if you have noticed any side effects or changes."
What are the benefits of intracranial vascular treatment vs. its potential complications?,"Benefits
 
 No surgical incision is necessary—only a small nick in the skin that does not need stitches.
 
 
 Catheter embolization:
 
 Embolization is a highly effective way of controlling bleeding, especially in an emergency situation.
 Embolization is much less invasive than conventional open surgery. As a result, there are fewer complications and the hospital stay is relatively brief—often only the night after the procedure. Blood loss is less than with traditional surgical treatment, and there is no obvious surgical incision. 
 This method can be used to treat tumors and vascular malformations that either cannot be removed surgically or would involve great risk if surgery was attempted.
 
 Embolization for brain aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations:
 
 Using detachable coils to close off an aneurysm, or a liquid embolic agent in the case of an arteriovenous malformation, is highly effective in preventing bleeding.
 Embolization is a treatment for cerebral aneurysms and fistulas that previously were considered inoperable. This procedure is less invasive and requires significantly less recovery time than open surgery for aneurysm repair. An additional benefit is minimal blood loss. Compared to open surgery, endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms has lower risks of severe complications, stroke or death.
 
 Acute ischemic stroke treatment:
 
 In cases of an acute ischemic, endovascular therapy (a minimally invasive procedure to improve blood flow in the brain's arteries) is performed. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, devices such as stent retrievers/aspiration systems are used to open blocked blood vessels or remove clots. Medications that dissolve clots or relax blood vessel spasms can also be injected. This restores blood flow to the affected area of the brain, increasing the chance for recovery.
 
 
 Risks
 
 There is a very slight risk of an allergic reaction if the procedure uses an injection of contrast material.
 Any procedure that places a catheter inside a blood vessel carries certain risks. These risks include damage to the blood vessel, bruising or bleeding at the puncture site, and infection. The doctor will take precautions to mitigate these risks.
 
 
 Embolization procedures:
 
 There is always a chance that an embolic agent can lodge in the wrong place and deprive normal tissue of its oxygen supply.
 There is a very small risk of death or significant illness including stroke. In the treatment of cerebral aneurysms, this risk is smaller compared to open surgery. Coil embolization of unruptured aneurysms and fistulas carries less risk than embolization of aneurysms with prior bleeding. Approximately 10 percent of cases require additional treatment or surgery."
What is Thermal Ablation for Tumor Treatment?,"Thermal ablation is a minimally invasive, image-guided treatment that uses heat or extreme cold to destroy tumor cells, including cancer. Doctors sometimes use ablation to treat benign tumors. This article focuses on ablation for cancerous tumors of the lung, liver, and kidney using cryoablation (sometimes called Cryotherapy), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and microwave ablation (MWA). Doctors sometimes use cryoablation to treat bone and breast tumors.
 While the ablation technique may vary between specific tumor types, the general approach for each procedure is largely the same. Thermal ablation uses ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to help guide a needle probe into a cancerous tumor. 
 RFA and MWA use heat to destroy cancer cells. Cryoablation uses extreme cold to freeze and destroy tumors. Your doctor can discuss the differences between ablation types specific to your diagnosis. For many tumor types, there are no known differences between using heat- and cold-based treatments."
What are some common uses of thermal ablation therapy?,"Thermal ablation is a viable and effective treatment option if you:
 
 are not a candidate for surgery due to other existing conditions.
 have multiple tumors in your lungs, bones, or liver that have spread from a cancer elsewhere in your body, such as the kidney, intestine, or breast (metastases). Your doctor can treat more than one lesion at the same time. 
 
 Your doctor can also use ablation with chemotherapy to treat one or more metastases that are growing in spite of chemotherapy. Your doctor can also use ablation to relieve pain when a tumor invades the chest wall or bone and to reduce the size of a tumor so that chemotherapy or radiation therapy are more effective.
 Ablation can be a complementary technique for treating lung tumors. Doctors may use it with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Ablation alone can treat small tumors, or the doctor may combine it with other therapies to relieve pain. Ask your doctor if thermal ablation is an effective treatment option for you."
What are the steps to take before undergoing thermal ablation therapy?,"Tell your doctor about all the medications you take, including herbal supplements. List any allergies, especially to local anesthetic, general anesthesia, or contrast materials. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or blood thinners before your procedure.
 Prior to your procedure, your doctor may test your blood to check your kidney function and to determine if your blood clots normally.
 You should always tell the doctor and technologist if you are pregnant. Doctors will not perform many tests during pregnancy to avoid exposing the fetus to radiation. If an x-ray is necessary, the doctor will take precautions to minimize radiation exposure to the baby. See the Radiation Safety page for more information about pregnancy and x-rays.
 Your doctor will likely tell you to fast after midnight before your procedure. They will tell you which medications you may take in the morning. You will need to change into a gown for the procedure.
 Some doctors recommend a short, overnight hospital stay after cryoablation of deep tumors. If the procedure uses a large, surgical incision (cryosurgery), you will need a short hospital stay. Doctors can perform percutaneous cryoablation on an outpatient basis, but you may need to stay overnight for observation. Plan to have someone drive you home after your procedure."
What are some common types of equipment used in thermal ablation therapy?,"Thermal ablation may use CT, ultrasound, or MRI equipment to guide the doctor in placing the ablation probes. Whether using RFA, MWA, or cryoablation, the systems consist of needle-like structures (sometimes called probes or antennae) connected via cords to a generator. Certain ablation systems have tanks of gas associated with them to help produce heat or cold. 
 Your procedure may use other equipment, including an intravenous line (IV), ultrasound machine, and devices that monitor your heartbeat and blood pressure.
 Computed Tomography (CT) equipment
  The CT scanner is typically a large, donut-shaped machine with a short tunnel in the center. You will lie on a narrow table that slides in and out of this short tunnel. Rotating around you, the x-ray tube and electronic x-ray detectors are located opposite each other in a ring, called a gantry. The computer workstation that processes the imaging information is in a separate control room. This is where the technologist operates the scanner and monitors your exam in direct visual contact. The technologist will be able to hear and talk to you using a speaker and microphone.
 Ultrasound equipment
 Ultrasound machines consist of a computer console, video monitor and an attached transducer. The transducer is a small hand-held device that resembles a microphone. Some exams may use different transducers (with different capabilities) during a single exam. The transducer sends out inaudible, high-frequency sound waves into the body and listens for the returning echoes. The same principles apply to sonar used by boats and submarines.
 The technologist applies a small amount of gel to the area under examination and places the transducer there. The gel allows sound waves to travel back and forth between the transducer and the area under examination. The ultrasound image is immediately visible on a video monitor. The computer creates the image based on the loudness (amplitude), pitch (frequency), and time it takes for the ultrasound signal to return to the transducer. It also considers what type of body structure and/or tissue the sound is traveling through.
 Magnetic resonance imaging equipment
 The traditional MRI unit is a large cylinder-shaped tube surrounded by a circular magnet. You will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel towards the center of the magnet.
 Short-bore MRI units have magnets that do not completely surround you. Newer MRI machines have a larger diameter bore, which can be more comfortable for larger patients or those with claustrophobia. “Open” MRI units are open on the sides. These are especially helpful for examining larger patients or those with claustrophobia. Open MRI units can provide high quality images for many types of exams; Open MRI may not be used for certain exams. For more information, consult your radiologist."
How does thermal ablation therapy work?,"The doctor will use ultrasound, CT, or MRI to help guide the probe into the tumor. RFA uses electrical currents in the range of radiofrequency waves. Microwave ablation uses electromagnetic waves in the microwave energy spectrum. Energy sent through the probe creates heat at its tip. This heat destroys cancer cells and closes small blood vessels, which reduces the risk of bleeding. The dead tumor cells are gradually replaced by scar tissue that shrinks over time.
 Cryoablation uses extremely cold temperatures to destroy tissue, including cancer cells. Using image-guidance, the doctor inserts a thin, wand-like needle called a cryoprobe through the skin and directly into tissue. They may use one or more cryoprobes. Argon or nitrogen gas flows through a tube into the cryoprobe, which brings the temperature at the tumor down to very low levels. These very cold temperatures freeze and destroy the tumor."
How is thermal ablation therapy performed?,"A specially trained interventional radiologist will most often perform image-guided, minimally invasive procedures such as ablation in an interventional radiology suite or occasionally in the operating room. Doctors can perform thermal ablation on an outpatient basis. After some ablation procedures, however, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight for observation.
 You will lie on the procedure table. The doctor or nurse may connect you to monitors that track your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, and pulse. A nurse or technologist will insert an intravenous (IV) line into a vein in your hand or arm to administer a sedative. 
 Your doctor will use medical imaging to precisely locate the tumor. The doctor will sterilize and cover this area with a sterile drape and numb it with a local anesthetic. This may briefly burn or sting before the area becomes numb.
 Your doctor may use intravenous conscious sedation and/or general anesthesia in addition to local anesthetic. They will determine the most appropriate type of anesthesia to use during the initial evaluation.
 Using imaging-guidance, your doctor will insert the needle through the skin and advance it to the site of the tumor. Once in place, the doctor will activate the probe, freezing or burning the area to kill the tumor cells. A large tumor may require the doctor to do multiple ablations by repositioning the needle electrode or by placing multiple needles into different parts of the tumor. This will help ensure no tumor tissue remains.
 Each ablation takes about 10 to 30 minutes, with additional time required if the doctor performs multiple ablations. The entire procedure usually takes one to three hours. At the end of the procedure, the doctor will remove the needle electrode and apply pressure to stop any bleeding. They will cover the opening in the skin with a dressing. No sutures are needed. The doctor or nurse will remove your IV line before you go home."
What to expect during and post thermal-ablation-therapy?,"The doctor or nurse may connect you to monitors that track your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, and pulse. 
 You will feel a slight pinch when the nurse inserts the needle into your vein for the IV line and when they inject the local anesthetic. Most of the sensation is at the skin incision site. The doctor will numb this area using local anesthetic. You may feel pressure when the doctor inserts the ablation probe. However, you will not feel serious discomfort. 
 If the procedure uses sedation, you will feel relaxed, sleepy, and comfortable. You may or may not remain awake, depending on how deeply you are sedated. Some patients may require general anesthesia, thus being asleep during the entire procedure. Talk with your doctor about which option is best for you. 
 Your doctor can control your pain immediately following ablation with medication via IV or by injection. Afterward, oral pain medication can control any mild discomfort. You may feel nauseous. Medication can ease this as well. You should be able to resume your usual activities within one to seven days. You should avoid lifting heavy objects for at least 72 hours. 
 Only about ten percent of patients will still have pain a week following an ablation. About one-third of patients may develop fever and flu-like symptoms within days after the ablation. This is the body’s reaction to the ablation. It often resolves within 10 days of the procedure."
What healthcare professionals interpret the results of a thermal ablation therapy and how can you obtain them?,"The interventional radiologist or doctor treating you will determine the results of the procedure. They will send a signed report to your referring physician, who will share the results with you. 
 Your interventional radiologist may recommend a follow-up visit. This visit may include a physical check-up, imaging exam(s), and blood tests. During your follow-up visit, tell your doctor if you have noticed any side effects or changes."
What are the benefits vs. risks of Thermal Ablation?,"Benefits
 
 Thermal ablation is a relatively quick procedure and recovery is rapid. Chemotherapy may resume almost immediately in patients who need it. Recovery time for cryosurgery may be less than for open surgery.
 Thermal ablation is less expensive than other treatment options. 
 You may be released several hours after the procedure, or you may stay overnight. Overnight stays for pain control are usually unnecessary.
 Because the doctor only uses a small incision to pass the probe through the skin, damage to healthy tissue is minimal. 
 
 Risks
 
 Any procedure that penetrates the skin carries a risk of infection. The chance of infection requiring antibiotic treatment appears to be less than one in 1,000. Also, some bleeding may result.
 While your doctor takes care to avoid damage to surrounding tissue using imaging guidance, damage to normal structures may occur. Depending on the site of treatment, ablation may result in pain, organ inflammation, abscess, or infection.
 Complications related to procedure medications, including anesthesia, may occur.
 This procedure may involve exposure to x-rays. However, radiation risk is not a major concern when compared to the benefits of the procedure. Always tell your doctor and x-ray technologist if you are pregnant. See the Radiation Safety page for more information about pregnancy and x-rays and the Radiation Dose page for information about radiation risk.
 About one in four patients may develop a “post-ablation syndrome” with flu-like symptoms that appear three to five days after the procedure and usually last about five days. An occasional patient may remain ill for two to three weeks. You can manage fever and other symptoms with oral acetaminophen or ibuprofen."
What are the limitations of Thermal Ablation?,"There is a limit to the amount of tumor tissue that thermal ablation can destroy. This is due to limitations with current equipment. Technical advances will permit treatment of larger tumors in the future. Microscopic tumors that medical imaging cannot see cannot be ablated. Tumors smaller than 2 to 3 mm (1/10 inch) in size are often not seen with current imaging technology. 
 Ablation is a localized therapy. It can only treat disease at a single site. It cannot always treat cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Because doctors are only able to treat the tumors they see on radiologic images, microscopic cancer cannot be treated."
What is a Linac used for?,"A medical linear accelerator (LINAC) is the device most commonly used for external beam radiation treatments for patients with cancer. It delivers high-energy x-rays or electrons to the region of the patient's tumor. These treatments can be designed in such a way that they destroy the cancer cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. The LINAC is used to treat all body sites, using conventional techniques, Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT), Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Stereotactic Body Radio Therapy (SBRT)."
What is a LINAC and how it works?,"The linear accelerator uses microwave technology (similar to that used for radar) to accelerate electrons in a part of the accelerator called the ""wave guide,"" then allows these electrons to collide with a heavy metal target to produce high-energy x-rays. These high energy x-rays are shaped as they exit the machine to conform to the shape of the patient's tumor and the customized beam is directed to the patient's tumor. The beam is usually shaped by a multileaf collimator that is incorporated into the head of the machine. The patient lies on a moveable treatment couch and lasers are used to make sure the patient is in the proper position. The treatment couch can move in many directions including up, down, right, left, in and out. The beam comes out of a part of the accelerator called a gantry, which can be rotated around the patient. Radiation can be delivered to the tumor from many angles by rotating the gantry and moving the treatment couch."
Who operates the LINAC?,The patient's radiation oncologist prescribes the appropriate treatment volume and dosage. The medical physicist and the dosimetrist determine how to deliver the prescribed dose and calculate the amount of time it will take the accelerator to deliver that dose. Radiation therapists operate the linear accelerator and give patients their daily radiation treatments.
How is safety ensured when treating with LINAC?,"Patient safety is very important and is assured in several ways.
 Before treatment is delivered to the patient, a treatment plan is developed and approved by the radiation oncologist in collaboration with the radiation dosimetrist and medical physicist. The plan is double-checked before treatment is given and quality-assurance procedures are performed to ensure that the treatment will be delivered as planned.
 Quality assurance of the linear accelerator is very important. There are several systems built into the accelerator so that it will not deliver a higher dose than the radiation oncologist has prescribed. Each morning before any patient is treated, the radiation therapist performs checks on the machine to make sure that the radiation intensity is uniform across the beam and that it is working properly. In addition, the medical physicist conducts more detailed monthly and annual checks of the linear accelerator.
 Modern linear accelerators also have internal checking systems that do not allow the machine to be turned on unless all the prescribed treatment requirements are met.
 During treatment, the radiation therapist continuously observes the patient using a closed-circuit television monitor. There is also a microphone in the treatment room so that the patient can speak to the therapist if needed. Port films (x-rays taken with the treatment beam) or other imaging tools such as cone beam CT are checked regularly to make sure that the beam position doesn't vary from the original plan.
 Safety of the staff operating the linear accelerator is also important. The linear accelerator sits in a room with lead and concrete walls so that the high-energy x-rays are shielded and no one outside of the room is exposed to the x-rays. The radiation therapist must turn on the accelerator from outside the treatment room. Because the accelerator only emits radiation when it is actually turned on, the risk of accidental exposure is extremely low."
What is thyroid cancer?,"Thyroid cancer is cancer that starts in the thyroid. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck that wraps around the windpipe windpipe, or trachea. The thyroid gland uses iodine absorbed from food to produce hormones that control how your body uses energy. Most thyroid cancers can be cured. See the Thyroid Disease page for more information.
 There are five types of thyroid cancer:
 Papillary thyroid cancer: 70 percent of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer have papillary thyroid cancer. This cancer originates in the cells where thyroid hormone is stored. It is slow-growing and does not easily spread into nearby tissue.
 Follicular thyroid cancer: this type of thyroid cancer also starts in the cells where thyroid hormone is stored. It is more aggressive than papillary cancer and often spreads into the bloodstream, lungs or bones. Most patients are over the age of 40. 
 
 Hurthle cell cancer is a rare type of thyroid cancer. This used to be considered a variant of follicular thyroid cancer but is now classified as a distinct type of thyroid cancer. Hurthle cell cancers are more likely to have spread outside the thyroid at the time of diagnosis
 Medullary thyroid cancer: This type of cancer is rare. It develops in the cells of the thyroid that make a hormone that helps the body maintain the right level of calcium. It may run in families. 
 Anaplastic thyroid cancer: This is the rarest form of thyroid cancer. It is aggressive and hard to treat. Most patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer are over the age of 60."
What are the treatment options for thyroid cancer?,"Treatment options overview
 Your treatment options depend on the type of thyroid cancer, the tumor stage, and how far it has spread. Your doctor may order CT scans, CT/PET scans or a fine needle biopsy to help determine the right treatment for you. 
 Surgery to remove the thyroid gland is the primary treatment for most thyroid cancers. Doctors often use radioactive iodine therapy after surgery to destroy any remaining thyroid tissue. 
 Standard options include:
 Surgery: Surgical removal of the thyroid is called thyroidectomy. The surgeon makes an incision at the base of the neck and removes the thyroid gland. If the cancer is limited to one part of the thyroid, the surgeon may remove just that part. This is called a thyroid lobectomy.
 The surgeon also may remove lymph nodes in the neck and other tissue, including four small parathyroid glands. 
 If the surgeon removes your thyroid, you will need to take a daily manmade hormone to replace the hormones no longer produced by the thyroid. If the surgeon removes your parathyroid gland, you will also need to take calcium supplements. 
 Radioactive iodine: Radioactive iodine (I-131) is an isotope of iodine that emits radiation. Thyroid cells, including most thyroid cancer cells, absorb iodine. When you swallow I-131, it enters the bloodstream and is absorbed by the thyroid cells, where it begins destroying them. This is an effective way to target and treat some thyroid cancers. Patients usually receive this treatment after surgery to any destroy remaining thyroid tissue and cancer cells. Doctors also use I-131 to treat patients with recurring thyroid cancer. See the Radioactive Iodine page for more information.
 External beam radiation therapy (EBT): EBT uses radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. EBT uses a linear accelerator to deliver high-energy x-ray beams to the tumor. The precise beam targets cancer cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. Patients who are unable to undergo surgery or I-131 treatment often receive EBT. Treatment is delivered for short periods of time, five days a week for four to six weeks. See the External Beam Therapy page for more information.
 Chemotherapy: This treatment uses drugs to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Anaplastic thyroid cancer patients may receive chemotherapy with EBT. Chemotherapy is usually delivered over a set period with breaks in between to help ease any side effects.
 Targeted Therapy: This is a new option for patients with advanced cancer or cancer that resists treatment. Drugs attack a specific target on the cancer cells, slowing down or even reversing cancer cell growth. 
 Alcohol ablation: This treatment uses ultrasound to guide an injection of alcohol into small thyroid cancer tumors. It treats thyroid tumors that cannot be removed with surgery and thyroid cancer that returns after being treated."
How do I choose the different treatment options for thyroid cancer?,"In addition to talking with family and friends, you will need a team of doctors to help advise you. This team may include a surgeon, a radiologist, a radiation oncologist, a medical oncologist, and an endocrinologist. Endocrinologists specialize in diseases of the glands. Radiation oncologists treat cancer with radiation. Medical oncologists treat cancer with drugs. You and your care team will create a treatment plan that works best for your cancer."
"If I choose surgery for thyroid cancer, will I need radiation therapy or vice versa?","Surgery is the primary therapy for thyroid cancer and is often effective. If the tumor is large, has spread to lymph nodes, or you are at high risk for the cancer returning after treatment, you will most likely have surgery followed by I-131 treatment. Medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer patients undergo surgery followed by EBT and chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Treatment for advanced thyroid cancer may consist of all the above."
What happens during radiation for thyroid cancer?,"Doctors use two types of radiation for thyroid cancer patients: 
 You will swallow a capsule or pill that contains radioactive iodine (I-131). Both healthy and cancerous thyroid cells absorb the I-131, which destroys them. This treatment is usually given in a hospital. You may stay overnight. During the treatment and for a short period after, you will give off radiation. Your doctor will tell you how to protect your family, friends and pets at home. See the Radioactive Iodine Therapy page for more information. 
 External Beam Therapy (EBT): EBT begins with treatment planning using either x-rays or a computed tomography (CT) scan. These exams help plan the type and direction of radiation beams to treat the cancer. Each treatment will last a few minutes each day, although it may take longer to get you set up. Once the radiation starts, you will hear some electrical noise and see warning lights from the machine. Patients do not feel the radiation during treatment."
What are possible side effects of radiation therapy for thyroid cancer?,"Radioactive iodine (I-131): Patients generally tolerate this treatment well. Short-term side effects include tenderness and swelling around the thyroid, nausea, swelling of the salivary glands, dry mouth, and sometimes changes in how things taste. Some patients find they are unable to make tears, leading to dry eyes and problems with contact lenses. Less frequent side effects include a lower sperm count in men and irregular periods in women. Women should avoid becoming pregnant for 6-12 months after treatment. Patients who have had I-131 treatment may have a slightly higher risk of developing leukemia in the future. This is extremely rare.
 External beam therapy (EBT): After several EBT sessions, patients may become tired. Getting adequate rest is important. Doctors usually advise patients to try to stay as active as they can. Patients may have skin changes or irritation in the neck area where the radiation has passed through the skin. Other side effects include trouble swallowing, dry mouth, and hoarseness. Most of these side effects are easy to manage and go away once treatment ends."
What kind of treatment follow-up for thyroid cancer,"After your thyroid cancer treatment is complete, you and your treatment team will decide on a follow-up plan. You may have an annual whole body iodine scan to monitor for any signs of cancer. All thyroid cancer patients will require thyroid replacement hormones. Your doctor will regularly monitor your thyroid levels, including a protein called thyroglobulin (Tg). Tg is made by normal thyroid tissue and abnormal thyroid cancer cells. Once the thyroid is destroyed or removed, your Tg level will be low or zero. Rising levels of Tg may mean your cancer has returned. Your doctor may also use ultrasound exams to ensure no new nodules are forming. Medullary thyroid cancer patients will also have their blood checked for calcitonin and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels. These markers may be the first sign that medullary thyroid cancer has returned. Anaplastic thyroid cancer patients will need to continue seeing both a medical and a radiation oncologist. These appointments start soon after treatment to address any side effects and determine next steps. Your doctor may order CT or PET scans at these visits. See the PET/CT Scan page for more information."
